Feigen Collection,28 May - 12 September 2010, no. 9 (as Gerini [?]).Crowned and holding an orb and martyr’s palm, the male saint depicted in this panel is almost certainly Saint Sigismund, an historical king of Burgundy.He succeeded his father to the throne in 516 C.E. and after years spent as a penitent, was thrown down a well by his political enemies. His remains were later recovered and a shrine was built in his honor near the Abbey of Saint Maurice d’Agaune (now Switzerland).As Laurence Kanter notes, Sigismund remained a largely local saint until his relics were translated to Prague by Emperor Charles IV in 1354.His cult then began to take on an international profile and became closely connected in Italy with the Ghibelline cause; Charles IV named his own son Sigismund, and thus the saint’s close association with the imperial family.Kanter dates this Saint Sigismund to circa 1380-90. and given the timeline of Saint Sigismund’s wider veneration in Europe, has suggested that the present panel may be the earliest depiction of the saint in Tuscan painting.It may have been a lateral element of a larger altarpiece, or perhaps an independent painting for veneration; either way, its subject suggests that it was likely painted for a patron with Ghibelline sympathies.The attribution of this painting to Gerini was supported by Miklòs Boskovits, who considered it an early work of the artist.An alternate attribution to Spinello Aretino has also been suggested.",100000,150000,94500,USD,TRUE,"$100,000.00 ","$150,000.00 ","$94,500.76 ",TRUE

Feigen Collection, 28 May – 12 September 2010, no. 16.This Martyrdom of Saint Blaise is one of three scenes from the life of the saint, parts of a predella for an as yet unidentified altarpiece by Allegretto Nuzi likely painted after his return from Florence to his native Fabriano.The other surviving elements from the predella, the Arrest of Saint Blaise and a Saint Blaise imprisoned and beaten with iron rods, were together in with the dealer Lorenzelli, Bergamo in 1950, and are now in the Alana Collection.1 When the present panel was in the collection of Fritz Bamberger, Bernard Berenson recognized its authorship, if not the exact episode depicted.The two other panels were published by George Kaftal in 1952, who reported that Roberto Longhi had given them to Nuzi.In 2003, Everett Fahy was the first to connect the three panels when the Alana paintings appeared at auction.It is likely that there may have been other episodes from the saint’s life as part of the predella, including his torture with iron wool carders, the travail which provided his most recognizable iconographic attribute.In her discussion of the Alana panels, Ada Labriola notes that no likely candidate for the final altarpiece, likely a polyptych, can be suggested. The veneration of Saint Blaise was popular in Fabriano and the Marches, and there were likely a number of churches dedicated to him in and around the town which could have required an altarpiece.2She dates this group to circa 1350-55, on the basis of the still-strong influence of Florentine painting. Allegretto was documented in Florence in 1346, where he spent time in the studios of Bernardo Daddi and Puccio di Simone.This dating is also supported by Laurence Kanter, who observes that by 1360, Nuzi’s pictorial style begins to shift to a more obvious interest in decorative patterning and geometric composition.In a private communication, Matteo Mazzalupi has tentatively suggested a date of the 1360s, noting that the distinctively shaped red shield held by the soldier at the center of the composition is similar to a more elaborately realized one held by Saint Michael in a triptych painted for San Domenico, Fabriano, which is dated 1365 (now Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome, inv. 40204).1.The two Alana panels were sold together on 9 July 2003, lot 80, at Christie’s London.The Saint Blaise imprisoned and beaten with Iron Rods is in damaged state.2.There was an important Benedictine Abbey of San Biagio in Caprile in Campodonico (south of Fabriano) as well as a church dedicated to him in Fabriano itself.See A.

Feigen Collection, 28 May – 12 September 2010, no. 36.Although relatively little is known of Maso's early training, he was a disciple of Andrea del Sarto and Pontormo, as can be seen in the monumental construction of his figuresas well as in his color palette, which is derived from Pontormo's bold and coloristic sensibility.According to Vasari, he trained with Pier Francesco Foschi, whose predilection for simple, severe compositions inspired by Florentine High Renaissance models became an important element of Maso’s style. Foschi’s adaptation of Pontormo’s elongated facial types and mannerist interpretation of sacred themes also influenced Maso. Held in high regard by hiscontemporaries, Maso received an important commission in 1570-1571 forwork on the decorationof thestudioloof Francesco I in the Palazzo Vecchio, completing two works --The Diamond MineandThe Fall of Icarus-- for his patron.The composition of the present painting is nearly identical to that seen in a Resurrection of Christ in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, where it had previously been considered a Florentine painting of circa 1560. The Vienna Resurrection had also previously been given to Francesco Salviati, and more recently has been attributed to Giulio Clovio by Philippe Costamagna. Costamagna, along with Robert Simon and Larry Feinberg previously attributed this panel to Maso da San Friano, an attribution endorsed in print by both Larry Kanter and John Marciari, the latter of whom also gives the Vienna picture to Maso.11.

Feigen.Bernardino di Betto, called Pinturicchio (so-called because of his small stature), was one of the leading painters in Umbria during the second half of the 15th century and into the early 16th century.A contemporary of Perugino, with whom he collaborated from 1481-1482 on frescoes for the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Pinturicchio quickly established his reputation throughout Umbria, where his lively and poetic style as well as his rich color palette were celebrated among an elite clientele, including personalities such as Cardinal Domenico della Rovere and later the Borgia Pope Alexander VI.Despite his considerable activity as a painter of large-scale altarpieces and frescoed cycles in and around Rome and his native Perugia, he also painted a number of small devotional works, of which the present Nativity is a fine example.A late work by the artist, it was likely painted in Siena where he lived for the lastdecade of his life from about 1504-1513 and where he worked primarily for the illustrious Piccolomini family, namely Cardinal Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini, later Pope Pius III, and his brother Andrea di Nanni Piccolomini.Smaller, detailed works such as this Nativity were a specialty of Pinturicchio’s in the last years of his career.Here, his delicate and lyrical hand has captured a peaceful scene enlivened by rich colors and gold details.A luminous figure of the Christ Child appears in the center of the lower foreground, reclined on a plush bale of hay.To His right appears the Virgin, whose red robe and blue mantel provides a pleasing balance to the warm tones of the yellow fabrics adorning the seated Joseph.Gazing down upon the Christ Child in similarly devotional poses are two angels, one of whose wings have been rendered with a delicate gradation of color.Equally delicate is the beautiful landscape with water and rolling hills that appears in the distance.We are grateful to ProfessorFilippo Todinifor endorsing the attribution to Pinturicchio the basis of photographs.He dates the work to about 1501, around the time of the frescoes of Santa Maria Maggiore a Spello, or shortly after.",80000,120000,88200,USD,TRUE,"$80,000.00 ","$120,000.00 ","$88,200.71 ",TRUE

Feigen Collection, 28 May – 12 September 2010, no. 38;Williamstown, MA, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, March 2014 - August 2020 (long term loan).Alessandro Allori began painting mythological and religious scenes on copper in the late 1560s, around the time that he worked on the paintings on slate for the studiolo of Francesco I de Medici. Like slate, the copper support emphasizes the bold, saturated color palette and porcelain skin tones popular in Florentine painting of the mid-to-late cinquecento. Many of Allori’s devotional scenes on copper are reduced versions of larger altarpieces, no doubt requested by patrons and appreciated by connoisseurs. Yet John Marciari (see Literature) has recently argued that the present copper is not a reduced version of a larger painting of the same subject, as previously assumed, but rather a first treatment of the subject that was later expanded. Though undated, the present example is signed A.A.F.F., which stands for “Alexander Allorius Florentinus faciebat.” The central focus, clear narrative, naturalism and bright colors are all characteristic of Allori’s approach to religious art in the Catholic Counter-Reformation.Another version of the same subject, signed and dated 1604, is now in the Galleria Doria-Pamphilj, Rome. Though it is not a large painting, the figures are proportionally smaller and less centrally focused than in the present lot. Marciari points out that the Feigen copper has more similarities with Allori’s design for a tapestry of the same subject completed as part of a Passion series between 1591 - 1602. The cartoon and preparatory drawings no longer survive, but the tapestry executed after Allori’s design for Christ Carrying the Cross is now in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence. The tapestry, like the Doria-Pamphilj painting, has more figures and is more elaborate than the smaller copper, but the figure of Simon of Cyrene, to the right of Christ in the tapestry, strikes a nearly identical pose in the Feigen painting: his right leg is bent rather than extended (as it is in the Rome painting). This suggests that this intimate copper, with its more focused composition, was in fact created in the first half of the 1590s, while Allori was working out designs for the tapestry, and before he expanded the composition for the 1604 painting. Marciari also notes that Simon of Cyrene resembles the figure of Lazarus in Allori’s Resurrection of Lazarus in Montepulciano, which is signed and dated 1593. That connection is relevant because Allori often repeated poses and figure types in paintings created around the same time.",100000,150000,113400,USD,TRUE,"$100,000.00 ","$150,000.00 ","$113,400.91 ",TRUE

The red derives from a copper-rich pigment brushed to the blue glaze, which is difficult to control in the firing and thus particularly unpredictable in its outcome. This chance effect is part of the ware’s attraction, giving each piece with a distinct identity, with individual patterns and tonal variations created as if by nature. Irregular purple splashes had an immense appeal to the literati and nobility of the time, who was able to appreciate simplicity, modesty and abstraction as opposed to the aristocracy in most regions and periods who preferred extravagant materials, lavish designs.Compare a slightly smaller Northern Song example, fired on a footring, glazed blue on the interior and purple on the exterior, preserved in the Palace Museum, Beijing and included in Selection of Jun Ware: The Palace Museum's Collection and Archaeological Excavation, Beijing, 2013, cat. no. 23.

Mirsky（1900-1974年）收藏The Classic Age of Chinese Ceramics, An Exhibition of Song Treasures from the Linyushanren Collection, this auction house, Hong Kong, 2012, cat. no. 28.Property from the Aoyama Studio CollectionIt is rare to find a black-glazed jar of this form and with such striking splashed abstract decoration. Dark wares of similar form were more often found with painted decoration of birds or plants; those featuring purely abstract brushwork such as this are rare. The russet brushstrokes on this jar not only have a strong calligraphic quality that would have appealed to the literati of the time, but also have an abstract element that gives this vessel a strikingly contemporary feel. The bold russet splashes contrast against the even blackish-brown glaze, creating a mottled effect often referred to as zhegu ban, or ‘partridge-feather mottling’. The size of the mottles began as small flecks and grew during the eleventh century. The generous application of russet by fingertips or brush is emblematic of its era, and the irregular yet well-controlled splashes of even tone make this jar an exceptional specimen of Cizhou ware. The well potted guan shape makes this jar even rarer among russet-splashed wares, with the glaze ending neatly at the lower body in typical late Song Cizhou fashion. Kilns in Northern China, especially those in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, were particularly active in producing black wares. Since around the twelfth century, potters had begun to add painted decoration on dark-glazed vessels, both in the form of representational designs and more abstract markings. Painted with simple spots or strokes that favor elegance over extravagance, these wares possess a minimalistic beauty that aligned very closely with the aesthetics of the time.

Kurland Collection: Part One》，埃斯卡納齊，倫敦，2017年，編號26This important and unusually large inscribed votive bronze sculpture is one of only three known dated examples from the Western Wei dynasty. Only two of them are known aside from the Swergold example: one dated to the first year of the Datong reign, now at the Tianjin Museum, illustrated in Saburo Matsubara, A History of Chinese Buddhist Sculpture, Tokyo, 1995, pl. 297c, the other dated to the fifth year of Datong, now at the Art Institute of Chicago, illustrated Matsubara, ibid., pl. 296. It depicts Shakyamuni Buddha seated in virasana on a waisted Sumeru throne raised on a four-legged pedestal. The right hand is held in abhaya mudra and the left hand in varada mudra. The intricately articulated robe covers the shoulders and falls in waves over the body and the front of the throne, the dynamism of the fabric's numerous folds alluding to the magnanimous energy within the divine sitter. This sculpture is a superb work of art which testifies to the enduring influence of Northern Wei (386-534) visual traditions on Western Wei (535-557) artistic practices, displaying a more exaggerated version of the Northern Wei style, with the body engulfed by cascading drapery laid out symmetrically. Cast in the fifth year of the latter dynasty, the superbly cast sculpture presents the iconic sculptural form of pointed cascading drapery and tied sash that is considered a more distinct sinicised style that occurs in the early sixth century at the Longmen Cave temples opened by the Northern Wei. This more sinicised style is first seen in Yungang Cave temples in the 490s, Cave 5, 6, as illustrated in Zhongguo meishu guanji: Diaosu bian 10: Yungang shiku diaoke zhongguo [Complete works of Chinese Art, Sculpture, vol. 10: Yungang cave temple carvings].

A similar depiction of a seated Buddha in stone, dated to 540, is illustrated in Matsubara, op cit., pl. 259B.The inscription on the base records that the present sculpture was commissioned by Monk Huile of the Yongchuan Temple. It may be translated as:""On the second day of the sixth month of the jiwei year, the fifth year of Datong (corresponding to 539), Monk Huile of Yongchuan Temple commissioned this image of Shakyamuni Buddha in the hope that the Emperor, seven generations of ancestors, all relatives and all sentient beings in this world might live serenely in the Buddhist universe"".",5000000,7000000,17115000,HKD,TRUE,"$637,364.85 ","$892,310.79 ","$2,181,699.88 ",UNKNOWN

The cult of Padmapani and this distinctive iconography emerged in the late 4th and early 5th century, and continued to be popular in the Tang dynasty. In this manifestation, Avalokitesvara, who is credited with the creation of all things animate and is believed to impersonate the power of creation, is depicted majestically standing against a flaming mandora to display his strength. The bodhisattva is dressed like a prince, adorned with opulent jewellery that serves also to denote his worldliness, as has vowed to remain in the world until all sentient beings have achieved enlightenment.Depicted seated in lalitasana adorned in sumptuous beaded jewelry with hair pulled into a high-top knot, the sculpture embodies the style of the high Tang period, with its sensitive treatment of the natural curves and flow of the body. This representational mode was influenced by Indian art, and the characteristics include a rounded face, well-modeled cheeks, a subtly sensuous silhouette, and opulent jewelry.

Apsaras, divine female spirits of the clouds and water, were used to enliven and animate votive altars, Buddhist triad groups, and cave temples. In these contexts, the representation of the principal subjects, particularly the Buddha with attendant bodhisattvas and arhats, was iconographically proscribed by sutras and contemporaneous religious treatises. By contrast, the treatment of secondary elements in sculptures and cave paintings allowed for greater artistic freedom. It is in this peripheral imagery that artists expressed their unique creative vision, and experimented with the boundaries of pictorial convention.

His expression is beautifully conveyed in serene meditation. His robe, covering both shoulders, is draped over his left arm, with his left hand shown holding a section of the robe, resting on his left knee. Stylistically, the figure can be attributed to the Northern Qi or early Sui dynasty.The Northern Qi dynasty was one of the most vibrant periods in the history of Chinese art, both religious and secular, as its openness towards foreigners, their ideas, beliefs and goods immensely enriched the local cultural climate. It was within this cosmopolitan climate that Buddhist sculpture experienced perhaps its most glorious moment. While in the Northern Wei dynasty, manners of depiction were adapted from traditional South and Central Asian prototypes, by the Northern Qi they had matured and developed into distinctive native styles. However they still emanate the seriousness of strong religious beliefs, which were rooted in the political instability of the mid-6th century, and had not yet moved towards the pleasant and more decorative imagery of the Tang dynasty. The refined native style of the Northern Qi can be seen on the sinicised facial features of the current sculpture, and the powerfully articulated feature of the hand clasping the robe.The distinct hexagonal waisted pedestal, so skilfully modelled on the current sculpture, first emerged in the Northern Zhou dynasties. Similar depictions of hexagonal pedestals can be seen in wall paintings of the Sui dynasty in the Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, caves 244, 393, 394 and 419.",1500000,2500000,1890000,HKD,TRUE,"$191,209.46 ","$318,682.43 ","$240,923.91 ",UNKNOWN

He is depicted seated with legs crossed in padmasana, eyes closed and face radiating an expression of serene meditation. His neatly cropped hair reveals the prominent ushnisha. Seated figures of the Sui dynasty are rarely found. The Sui dynasty’s brief unification of China produced a new sculptural synthesis, a majestic style of restrained elegance and controlled sensuality, which formed the basis of Tang Dynasty Buddhist sculpture. Here, the elegance of the richly gilded sculpture, which is devoid of the elaborate jewelry and exhibits a more slender face and body, suggests a Sui date.The Sui date can also be corroborated by close comparison of the current sculpture with the figure of Amitabha at the centre of an altarpiece in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, dated to the 13th year of the Kaihuang era (AD 593). The Boston altarpiece was originally excavated in the late 19th century in the vicinity of the Zhaozhou bridge, Hebei, entered the collection of Duan Fang, and was later acquired by Mrs Walter Scott Fitz, who donated it to the museum, accession no. 22.407. Both figures share the same sensational naturalism of casting, capturing the unwavering meditative posture of the Buddha, with the same distinctive posture in abhaya mudra, and similar intricately cast treatment of the drapery.A century ago, this figure of Amitayus was in the collection of Adolphe Stoclet (1871-1949), a Belgian industrialist, banker and famous art collector, whose villa in Brussels had been commissioned, down to the last detail, from Josef Hoffman (1870-1956), important architect and co-founder of the influential art and design cooperative, Wiener Werkstätte. It is considered the most important intact ensemble preserved from the ‘Jugendstil’ period of the early twentieth century and inscribed by UNESCO as a world heritage site. Stoclet collected Western as well as non-Western art from around the world, including many major Chinese works.

Of the six arms, one pair holds the hands in anjali mudra in front of the chest, while the others respectively hold a pierced star-shaped symbol of the sun and the moon, a kundika, a rosary, and a lotus stem with an attendant bud. The dynamic eleven-headed form is derived from the Indian tradition, where deities with supernatural powers had the ability to manifest themselves in as many as thirty-three different forms to help those in need. Here the eleven heads enable the bodhisattva to detect need in every direction, reminding devotees of the mercy and compassion of Avalokiteshvara. This Bodhisattva combines the qualities of a prince and an ascetic, with his crown and jewels combined with the yogi's antelope skin over his left shoulder and prayer beads in his middle right hand. Representing the range of Avalokiteshvara's forms and aspects, his eleven heads are finely articulated, all surmounted by a head of the Buddha Amitabha, with whom he is closely associated, and a miniature seated figure of Amitabha Buddha has been placed in the center of every crown. For the prototype of this iconographical depiction of Avalokiteshvara, see the eleven-headed six-armed copper alloy figure from Western Tibet in the Cleveland Museum of Art, accession no. 1975.101, illustrated in Marylin Rhie, Robert Thurman, and John Bigelow Taylor, Wisdom and Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet.

The kundika in the left hand, and the willow branch in the right, identify the figure as the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. The contours of the slender body are well defined in the contrapposto silhouette and the wet-drapery effect of the clothing, all of which are characteristic of Buddhist sculpture in the high Tang dynasty. The curving form of the deity’s torso achieves an almost dancelike movement. This highly recognizable stylistic element of the swayed-hip posture became especially popular during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (712-756), when sculptures in general became more dynamic in their design.Compare a similar bodhisattva image, with relatively large head and similar treatment of the robes, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, illustrated by Ulrich von Schroeder, Indo-Tibetan Bronzes, Hong Kong, 1981, p. 501, fig. 142F.

The inscription dates it to the Eastern Wei dynasty, which ruled northern China from 534 to 550 after the disintegration of the Northern Wei (386-534). Although it still retains strong stylistic influences from India, the treatment of the Eastern Wei Padmapani has become much more sinicized than Northern Wei examples, with less distinct Gandharan influences on key features of the sculpture, such as the drapery. Where Northern Wei figures utilize the Indian mode of representation with graceful curvilinear contours, lithe body, swaying hips and gently tilted head, the current figure stands tall and straight. It is an extremely fine sculpture, with an intricately incised design of the Buddha on the reverse.

Avalokiteshvara is the bodhisattva of compassion and protector of the world. Meher McArthur in Reading Buddhist Art, London, 2002, p. 43, states that Avalokiteshvara is the ‘subject of the 24th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, in which he is described as looking in all directions in order to attempt to save all beings from the suffering of the world.'

The throne beneath him is well-defined with a stepped cylindrical base surmounted by an open lotus blossom, the overlapping petals each individually articulated. Traces of the original gilt on lacquer can be seen throughout. The figure displays characteristics of the Five Dynasties period, but is more likely to date to the Liao period, whose emperors were devout Buddhists, and under whose reign religious art flourished. The Buddhist imagery of this period fused Tang dynasty styles, which appealed to the bold aesthetic favored by the Northern nomadic people, with the refined sensibility of Song dynasty artistic expression.

With the developments in porcelain production and the Emperor’s desire to create refined designs that were based on celebrated wares from China’s history, highly original compositions that were rooted in the past were produced. These lotuses appear to be inspired by Chenghua designs which featured bright red petals around a centre of yellow and green, as seen on a stemcup, from the Wu Lai Hsi, Carl Kempe and Meiyintang Collections, sold in these rooms, 5th October 2011, lot 28. The green leaves are reminiscent of Western acanthus leaves and demonstrate the level of cultural exchange during the Qing dynasty.This dish diverges slightly from typical doucai wares as the lotus blooms have not been pencilled in underglaze blue. Instead, they are outlined in razor-sharp iron red, creating an eye-catching contrast between them and the softer underglaze-blue lines.

WK.C6.Covered in a rich crushed-raspberry glaze with lavender streaks, wares of this type were highly favoured by the Yongzheng Emperor who commissioned copies of Jun wares to be produced at the imperial kilns in Jingdezhen. Also known as yaobian (transmutation glaze), Tang Ying (1682-1756), Superintendent of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen, recorded that potters were sent to Junzhou, Henan province in the 7th year of the Yongzheng reign (1729) to investigate the recipe for producing Jun glazes. Recent studies on flambé glaze have revealed that this new recipe required the application of a layer of copper-blue glaze with traces of lead, over a layer of red glaze, which when fired created the striking streaks so admired by the Emperor.A similar vase of this form and size, also covered in a lustrous glaze of rich crushed-raspberry glaze, is illustrated in Wang Qingzheng, ‘Yongzheng Imitations of Guan, Ge, Ru and Jun Wares’, Chinese Ceramics, Selected Articles from Orientations 1982-1998, Hong Kong, 1999, p. 270, fig. 9, where the author distinguishes its glaze from the typical flambé type (pp. 269-270).

Seal mark and period of Qianlong,N/A,N/A,N/A,A teadust-glazed hexagonal vase,,35.3,1,1,35.3,,,,,,,,,,,cm,,,"sturdily potted after the archaic fanghu form, the hexagonal body supported on a pronounced foot, gently curving at the shoulders to a flared neck, flanked by a pair of tubular loop handles, covered overall in rich mottled olive-green glaze, the base with a six-character seal markThe vase is in good overall condition.The present vase is notable for its lustrous and deep teadust glaze which perfectly complements the angular shape, and is a testament to the technical perfection achieved by craftsmen working at the imperial kilns in Jingdezhen under the Qianlong Emperor as well as his keen interest in antiquity. Its form is a reinterpretation of the archaic bronze hu form which was first developed by craftsmen working at the Guan kilns during the Song dynasty. Further reference to bronzes is made in the rich teadust glaze, inspired by their patina and an innovation of the Yongzheng period. This glaze was achieved through the precipitation of yellow crystal that stands out against the dark green background, producing what is known in Chinese as chayemo or ‘tea-leaf’ dust glaze effect.

The slightest irregularity would result in the rejection and destruction of the piece, thus pushing the craftsmen to the limits of their abilities, particularly in the production of large vessels such as the present. Furthermore, the hexagonal-section form indicates that this vase would have been created in a mould, which demanded acute precision, as the traditional method of using a potter’s wheel could only result in vessels of circular section.Qianlong mark and period vases of this form are also known in various monochrome glazes, such as a sky-blue glazed example illustrated in Sekai toji zenshu / Ceramic Art of the World, Tokyo, 1956, vol. 12, pl. 46; and two Ru-type vases, sold in these rooms, the first, 26th October 2003, lot 50, and the second, 9th October 2007, lot 1526.

There are very tiny burst glaze bubbles to the tip of the spout and the interior unglazed flange of the cover slightly polished to fit the kettle.this auction house Hong Kong, 29th April 1997, lot 621.This rare piece belongs to a special group of porcelain wares made under the direction of the Qianlong Emperor that combined contemporary elements with forms inspired by archaic bronzes. Its form is modelled after archaic bronze ritual vessels, he, made during the Zhou dynasty, while the motif of lotus and the Eight Treasures (bajixiang) hints at the increasing influence of Buddhism at court. The exceptional talent of the potters is evident not only in the successful transformation of a bronze form into porcelain, but also in their ability to combine decorative elements from different traditions.Originally inspired by pottery prototypes from the Neolithic period, bronze vessels of this form are believed to have been originally used as wine ewers or pitchers in the Shang and Zhou dynasty. Their function was somewhat revived in the Qing dynasty, as attested by Wang Guowei (1877-1927) in his ‘shuo he’ (On the he) from 1915, where he mentions that at banquets, those that could not tolerate drinking too much wine were offered a weaker version diluted with water poured from a he. Porcelain he appear to have been an 18th century innovation, and according to Palace documents, the first order for these vessels took place in the 3rd year of the Qianlong reign.Ewers of this unusual form are found in important private and museum collections; one in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, was included in the Museum’s exhibition K’ang-Hsi, Yung-Cheng and Ch’ien-Lung Porcelain Ware from the Ch’ing Dynasty in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, 1986, cat. no. 71; another in the Tianjin Municipal Museum is illustrated in Tianjin Shi Yishu Bowuguan cang ci [Porcelains from the Tianjin Municipal Museum], Tianjin, 1993, pl. 166; and a third in the collection of Her Majesty the Queen is illustrated in John Ayers, Chinese and Japanese Works of Art, London, 2016, vol. 1, pl. 424, together with a Jiaqing mark and period example, pl. 425.

There were strict regulations on the variety and quantity of tableware to be used by the different imperial members during the Qing dynasty.

A Yongzheng dish of this size, with reign mark and of the period, similarly decorated on the exterior with a yellow ground and delicately carved and green-enamelled waves, but of ogee form and with a plain white interior, is illustrated in Qingdai yuyao ciqi [Porcelains from the Qing dynasty imperial kilns in the Palace Museum collection], vol. 1, pt.

This decorative and colour scheme was employed from the Ming dynasty, as seen on yellow-ground bowls decorated with incised and green-enamelled dragons above crashing waves, which continued through to the Qing period; see a Yongzheng example of this dragon and wave design sold at this auction house Hong Kong, 31st October 1994, lot 570A.The interior of the present dish depicts Magu, the Daoist Goddess of longevity, returning from an excursion to the mountains in search of lingzhi fungus. Magu is often portrayed as a young and beautiful girl wearing an apron of leaves and carrying a basket of lingzhi fungus or peaches and typically accompanied by a spotted deer, the only animal capable of finding the sacred fungus of immortality. According to legend, after Magu became an immortal she witnessed the ocean changing into mulberry fields three times, hence implying her long life, and the crashing waves on the exterior of the present dish may refer to these events. First appearing on early-Ming porcelain, she gained popularity during the Kangxi period, and dishes of this design were made for women's birthday celebrations.For a smaller Yongzheng dish, with reign mark and of the period, decorated with a similar scene of Magu on a plain white background, see one sold at this auction house London, 8th December 1975, lot 143.",1200000,1800000,1512000,HKD,TRUE,"$152,967.56 ","$229,451.35 ","$192,739.13 ",UNKNOWN

There is a glaze line around the joint of the spout and a firing line (approx. 4.5 cm) to the lower joint of the handle on the 'peach' side.This well-known, successful design originated in the Yongle period, when the form of ewer of the Hongwu reign and ultimately the Yuan dynasty was developed and improved and matured to a highly pleasing model. Ewers of this form were produced in the Yongle reign in many different designs, but the peach-and-loquat version appears to have become the most popular, which it also remained in the Qing dynasty.A reconstructed ewer from the Yongle stratum of the Ming imperial kiln sites was included in the exhibition Jingdezhen Zhushan chutu Yongle guanyao ciqi [Yongle Imperial porcelain excavated at Zhushan, Jingdezhen], Capital Museum, Beijing, 2007, cat. no. 66.A Qianlong ewer of this design, from the Qing court collection and still in Beijing, is illustrated in Geng Baochang, ed., Gugong Bowuyuan cang Ming chu qinghua ci [Early Ming blue-and-white porcelain in the Palace Museum], Beijing, 2002, vol.

The Yongzheng Emperor took a keen interest in the work of various imperial manufactories in his empire, particularly the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen where artistic direction was led by his personal taste. Through his brilliant kiln supervisor, Tang Ying (1682-1756), he achieved a distinctive style and refinement by studying celebrated wares of the past and fine-tuning shapes to harmonious proportions, developing sophisticated designs and aspiring to the standard of the best works from Chinese history.Bowls of this type are rare; a similar but less elaborately painted pair of bowls was sold in our Hong Kong rooms, 31st October 1974, lot 194. While the motif has been inspired by early Ming blue and white designs, the Yongzheng craftsman has created a highly contemporary design by infusing the scroll with a featheriness that is characteristic of Western rococo scrolling fronds, which reflects the artistic and cultural exchange of his time.",400000,600000,693000,HKD,TRUE,"$50,989.19 ","$76,483.78 ","$88,338.77 ",UNKNOWN

Florence (neé Florence Jeannette Chaney) earned a Bachelor of Theology at the University of Chicago (class of 1908) and Master's degree from the same university in 1913. She had a great interest in people of other cultures, writing a Master's thesis titled ""The Social and Educational Protection of the Immigrant Girl in Chicago"" (1912), and following her graduation she became a Presbyterian missionary in China, serving in Huaiyuan county, Anhui province. Paul and Florence met in China and married in Huaiyuan in 1918, and raised two sons in Beijing.

The full scene showing the dramatic event of the eighteen-armed goddess brandishing weapons and triumphantly standing on the back of the buffalo demon is fully illustrated in a Nepalese cast sculpture from the fifteen century located in the Rubin Museum of Art (C2005.16.11, HAR65433) (P. Pal, Nepal: Where the Gods are Young, The Asia Society, exh. cat., 1975, p. 130, cat. no. 73). At the edges of this composition are two of Mahisauras’s kneeling demonic companions, or as Lerner and Kossack indicate, possibly the demon brothers Sumbha and Nisumbha, one which is shown impaled by a vajra and the other a chakra (M. Lerner and S. Kossack, The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art from the Samuel Eilenberg Collection, New York, 1991, p.148).This pairing of kneeling demons relates to the present sculpture who bears a vajra at his chest and another demon showing a chakra piercing his chest located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (acc. no. 1987.142.363) (M. Lerner and S. Kossack, ibid, 1991, p. 148, cat. no. 118). The parallel of styles between these two sculptures is almost uncanny as both figures are positioned in the same stance, wear chainmail vests and sashes falling in an identical manner across their thighs. In their raised left hand, they correspondingly wrestle a writhing snake. The styling of armbands and bracelets at the wrists, foliate tiaras as well as the anguished expressions reflected in their bulging eyes closely resemble one another. The plinth attached to the demon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art collection suggests that these two were not part of the same set, as the present sculpture was fashioned with tangs rather than a base. However, it is likely, based on the close stylistic similarities between these two sculptures, that they were fashioned in the same atelier.Property From the Estate of Raymond Cheven",3000,5000,8190,USD,TRUE,"$3,000.00 ","$5,000.00 ","$8,190.00 ",UNKNOWN

The divine mother sits in elegant equipoise in the posture of royal ease with the sash of the dhoti swaying with the gentle rhythm of her body. The secondary arms are folded at the elbow and raised towards the shoulders with weightless ease. The right hand gently cups a kapala, identifying her as the divine mother, while the other hand displays delicately folded fingers in shunya mudra. The slender limbs are decorated with bangles at the wrists, her neck adorned with a pendant necklace and long string of beads which falls between her breasts. The face in full serenity is framed by ornamental mismatched earrings and the head crowned with a foliate kirtimukha tiara. Sashes flair out from the crown, as the hair cascades in two braided locks over her shoulders.Mahalakshmi would originally have been part of a larger set, depicting the Ashtamatrika, or “eight mothers” who were worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists alike in the Kathmandu valley. The mother goddesses were believed to aid with fertility and act as the protector of newborns. The subject of the Ashtamatrika was recurring during the thirteenth and fourteenth century and a comparable copper cast depicting Mahalakshmi shows similarly styled mismatched earrings, elongated limbs, a tall chignon framed by a foliate tiara, a dhoti with fluttering pleats and a kapala gently placed in the goddess’ right palm (U. von Schroeder, Indo-Tibetan Bronzes, Hong Kong, 1981, p. 353, pl. 92C.) A cast of Varahi, another of the eight matrikas, likely coming from the same set, shows identical styling of the jewelry and patterning of the dhoti as well as a lotus base supporting the pendent right foot (see Pratapaditya Pal, Nepal: Where the Gods Are Young, New York, 1975, p. 129, cat no. 70, illus. p. 102). Other examples of matrikas include a cast of Brahmani, whose graceful posture and details including the kapala and kirtimukha crown also relate to the present sculpture (U. von Schroeder, ibid., p. 353, pl. 92F).The graceful rendering of an Uma-Maheshvara whose gestural movements and style mirror that of Mahalakshmi dates by inscription to 1345, confirming the period in which the present sculpture was made (I.

The musical takes place in early 1900, in an area of Charleston, South Carolina, which is home to a black fishing community. Bess (Dorothy Dandridge) - a woman with a dishonourable past, wants to end her relationship with her bully of a boyfriend, after he is wanted for murder. The only person who comes to her aid, and is willing to overlook her past, is crippled Porgy. The two fall in love, but can the townsfolk approve of their relationship ? Owing to the controversial subject matter, the film, although very popular, only had a limited run in certain cinemas, and did not recover its expenses. It was the first English language musical to be shown in Germany in its original version with subtitles, rather than being dubbed. This film was also the last that Samuel Goldwyn produced.

The piece features great wording to lure you into the cinema….'Bullitt comes to this theatre soon. That ought to shake up the place pretty good. Not many freaky cops like Bullitt around. You look at the Italian shoes and the turtleneck and you have to wonder. You listen to the official beefs about 'personal misconduct,' 'disruptive influence,' you figure he's got to be up to trade. But when some rare Chicago blood starts spilling in San Francisco, they give Bullitt the mop. They weren't exactly doing him a favor. But they've done a great big one for you.'It is rare for anyone to have an original poster signed, as the majority of signatures are on pieces of paper, photographs and video/dvd sleeves. It is unusual to have the film's poster with you when you try to obtain signatures.This action thriller was directed by Peter Yates, and stars Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn and Jacqueline Bisset. It is undoubtedly Steve McQueen's most famous role, where he plays San Francisco Police Lieutenant Frank Bullitt. Bullitt and his team are given the important task of guarding, who they think is, mobster Johnny Ross over the weekend, as Ross is due to give evidence on the Monday, in a Senate subcommittee hearing on organised crime. Things don't go quite to plan when two hitmen burst in and shoot Ross, who later dies in hospital. Bullitt is then determined to find who was behind killing the witness in his protection, and in doing so a bigger story unfolds. The other star of the film is the 1968 Ford Mustang, which Bullitt drives in the exciting, and now classic car chase scenes.Linen backedMaterial of Piece: Paper, backed on linenExcellent condition, with the colours remaining very bright.

Its reality is based on the reality of the hidden inherent laws of the picture surface.” – Hans HofmannThroughout his career, Carl Holty (1900-1973) was at the heart of 20th Century abstraction. After studying under Hans Hofmann at the Munich Academy, Holty went on to become an integral member of the inner circles of both European and American abstraction. While Holty was living in Paris in the 1930s, Robert Delaunay asked him to join the artists group Abstraction-Création. (Holty and Alexander Calder were the only two American members at the time.) After Paris, Holty moved to New York, where he earned the praise of Harold Rosenberg and chaired the American Abstract Artists group. Holty also pursued teaching as a professor at the American Artists’ School where he taught Ad Reinhardt.In Untitled (1960), we can see the influence of Hofmann’s teaching in Holty’s emphasis on color and the materiality of paint. At this stage in his career, Holty had given up every trace of figuration in favor of pure abstraction à la Hofmann. In the current work, the amorphous panels of color become tectonic plates, and the fault lines between these ‘plates’ demarcate the fields of action for Holty’s experimentation with the medium of paint. For example, in the upper third of the painting, the narrow slab of rich, red paint sharply contrasts, yet enlivens, the surrounding passage of diaphanous blue. There is perhaps the suggestion of a landscape, where the roughness of the gray paint gives way to the airiness of a blue sky, but this landscape, if we can locate one, is more so metaphysical than strictly geographical. As they rub up against each other, the panels of paint rise and fall, thereby lending the composition a certain sense of depth – an almost topographical appearance. However, Holty simultaneously emphasizes the flatness of the canvas, suggesting that the picture plane is a sufficient reality in and of itself.",10000,15000,75600,USD,TRUE,"$10,000.00 ","$15,000.00 ","$75,600.00 ",TRUE

Unframed.Estate of Keith Haring, New York (gift of the artist in 1988)The Keith Haring Foundation (by bequest from the above in 1990)Enchantingly mystical and delightfully surreal, Untitled by David Bowes is a remarkable early example of the artist’s unique painterly style. Executed in 1988, following a period of extensive travel and experimentation for the artist, the present work combines elements of mythology, allegory, and historical reference that would come to characterize Bowes’s practice. Evocative of the Symbolist works of Odilon Redon that had deeply inspired the artist from a young age, Untitled displays the same witty imagery and pointed playfulness that also defines the work of Bowes’s peer and friend, Keith Haring, and fits elegantly within his collection.Bowes first met Haring in 1982, while living and working in the East Village; they were part of the same artistic community and had many friends in common. At Haring’s suggestion, Bowes began showing work with the Tony Shafrazi Gallery, and Haring admired his paintings so much he requested an exchange of works. In 1988, Bowes visited Haring’s studio to make the trade: “Keith’s studio was full of light the sunny day I brought the painting to him. On the floor were dozens of wonderful new works in black paint on white paper, organized row on row in a giant square. We looked at those and talked about them. He was just back from a stay in Paris and we talked about the different ways his time there showed up in his drawings. Keith liked my little painting and the way it seemed to rhyme in a funny way with one Brion Gysin had given him. He went and found that and we looked at the two together - similar in size with circle forms on a yellow ground.”In the end, Haring was so enamored of Untitled that he exchanged “the best” paper collage work he had for it, and Bowes’s work remained in his collection as an inspiration and as a symbol of the two artists’ friendship.",100,200,2268,USD,TRUE,$100.00 ,$200.00 ,"$2,268.00 ",FALSE

Framed without glazing.Perry Rubenstein Gallery, New YorkAcquired from the above by the present owner in February 1992Eric Fischl’s Untitled (1987) is a study for a larger painting, Growing Up in the Company of Women I (1987), which belongs to his series of multi-panel paintings (1983-1989). In this series, which he has called his “second act,” Fischl fragments the image such that each panel becomes a shard of memory or fantasy. Growing Up in the Company of Women I (1987) depicts a young boy (the subject of the study) playing catch with a naked woman, presumably his mother. In this way, Fischl transforms the most quintessential, suburban pastime into an unsettling and shocking drama. However, the banality of this scene endows Fischl’s painting with an unreconcilable ambiguity. Are they just playing catch? Furthermore, in this work, Fischl isolates the young boy from his mother by placing them on different, disjointed panels. Existing in different worlds and upon different panels, the boy and the woman are completely unaware of each other’s nakedness; however, there remains a tension between the two figures who are inextricably bound together through the game of catch. Arthur Danto writes, “But in Fischl’s paintings, the psychology is of everyday life. In his suburbs, people act out the fantasies that people used mainly to dream about.”[1] The young boy of Untitled, with his hand curled around a baseball, thus suggests several of Fischl’s essential concerns with adolescence, desire, and taboo.[1] Arthur Danto, “Formation, Success, and Mastery: Eric Fischl Through Three Decades,” in Eric Fischl: 1970-2000 (New York, The Monacelli Press, 2000), 18.",20000,30000,23940,USD,TRUE,"$20,000.00 ","$30,000.00 ","$23,940.00 ",FALSE

Framed.Gekkoso Gallery, TokyoOne of the most significant landscape painters of his generation, Mikhail Romadin lived a long life which coincided with nearly the entire existence of the Soviet Union. He was decorated with all the orders and prizes a Soviet artist could aspire to, including the coveted title People’s Artist of the Soviet Union, while his paintings were acquired for the country’s most prestigious art museums. Despite his success and official recognition during his lifetime, Romadin was not an artist who built his career by conforming to the ideals of the regime. His early works in particular show the modernist influence of his teachers at Vkhutemas, especially Robert Falk.Probably painted on or near Maslovka Street as other known winter landscapes by Romadin from the late 1940s, the present work beautifully conveys the mood of a sunny winter’s afternoon in what was then still a rural part of Moscow.

The canvas would appear to have been extended on the right edge as there is evidence of a previous tacking margin with associated raised fold lines, craquelure and minor losses. The right edge has been reinforced with a linen strip-lining in order to facilitate the extension. The modern stretcher would appear to be contemporary to the extension. A paper label is adhered to the reverse of the canvas in the upper right corner.Paint SurfaceThe paint surface has an uneven, glossy application of varnish. The varnish would appear to have discoloured and there is evidence of an ingrained dirt layer which is particularly noticeable within the pale painted flowers. The paint surface displays scattered fine lines of slightly raised craquelure with a few associated tiny paint losses. Inspection under ultraviolet light confirms the discoloured opaque varnish layer. Inspection under ultraviolet light also shows intermittent retouchings which have varying fluorescences corresponding to the extension running along and close to the right edge. Many of these retouchings are also visible in natural light.SummaryThe painting would therefore appear to be in essentially good condition. The extension on the right edge and the associated retouching should be noted.Condition 11 of the Conditions of Business for Buyers (Online Only) is not applicable to this lot.Exhibition catalogue Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gerasimov.

Vystavka proizvedenii k 100-letiyu so dnya rozhdeniya, 1981Moscow, State Historical Museum, Aleksandr Gerasimov. K 135-letiyu khudozhnika, 10 February - 14 April 2016Painted at Gerasimov’s house in Sokol, Wildflowers shows the artist’s rendition of a more informal, private genre to which he dedicated regular time throughout his career, despite being predominantly known as the official painter of Soviet Union’s political and cultural elites.Gerasimov himself recalled: ‘What great pleasure it is to paint flowers (...) Flowers are the earth’s sweet-smelling nectar, breaking through its great mass (...) Still lifes ‘cleanse’ the eyes of the painter. Painting flowers is like resting after a long tiring road’ (A.Gerasimov, Zhizn' khudozhnika, Moscow, 1963, p.101).Bursting with colour, the wildflowers assembled by the artist with evident fondness – among them cornflowers, daisies, and globeflowers – epitomise joy and a zest for life. This is not coincidental considering that the work was executed in 1945, as the country celebrated the end of the Second World War. The sunlit table and the lush greenery in the background work as contrasting elements in this large-scale still life, with its joyous atmosphere symbolic of the hope and renewal filling the air. Wildflowers was shown at the artist’s 100th-anniversary exhibition in 1981 and is listed in the exhibition catalogue. It is also listed and illustrated in the 1988 monograph on the artist, in both cases with slightly different dimensions, which can be explained by the canvas having been extended on the right-hand side. Most recently, the present lot was included in the 2016 retrospective exhibition of Gerasimov’s work at the State Historical Museum in Moscow.Property of the Family of the Artist",180000,250000,302400,GBP,TRUE,"$224,792.82 ","$312,212.25 ","$377,651.94 ",TRUE

Born in the mountains of Corsica, Filippi first came to Moscow in 1974 where she was appointed cultural attaché at the French Embassy in Moscow. ‘Beautiful, elegant, charming when she likes you, icy-cold when she doesn’t (…) Her quick determination, readiness to face all fears, reluctance to let anyone down, keen interest in Russia… She carried herself well in dangerous situations, disarming all with her smile and grace’ – recalled the famous Russian dissident and intellectual Natalia Stolyarova. It was during Filippi’s first visit to Moscow that she befriended Vladimir Weisberg and fell in love with his work. ‘In a post-Khrushchev era when officials were still fighting “abstraction and formalism”, when no museum would exhibit, let alone buy his work, she quietly began her own collection.’ (quoted in Wladimir Weisberg: collection particulière Elfrida Filippi, Moscow, 1997). Over the course of her diplomatic career in Russia, Elfrida Filippi amassed the greatest private collection of Weisberg’s work.Property from a Private Collection, France",15000,20000,30240,GBP,TRUE,"$18,732.74 ","$24,976.98 ","$37,765.19 ",TRUE

The present work depicts Sylvie in her bedroom situated in the family's elegant Paris hôtel, whereas the painting he chose for the exhibition, shows Sylvie in their Nemours residence.The delicately executed composition juxtaposes a rigorous geometrical construction (the bed canopy, the perfectly aligned polka dots of the curtains, and the footboard) to the soft curves of the flounces and the burlwood bedside table. The spare background with a limited color palette is a perfect foundation against which Sylvie's colorful and carefully modelled figure punctuates the almost monochromatic composition.A fascination with geometry, simplicity and stylization characterizes his art and demonstrate his ties with the Art Déco world and its primary figures. Bernard Boutet de Monvel’s style and personality, along with his French elegance and charm, won over the Americans who would eventually crown him 'the handsomest man in Europe'! His notoriety in the United States was widespread from the 1920s onwards, with exhibitions and retrospectives all bearing witness to his tremendous talent.French",60000,80000,75600,USD,TRUE,"60,000","80,000","$75,600.00 ",TRUE

Two weeks in November of that year were not enough, and the artist returned in February 1910 for a further two weeks, when he painted Jardín de los Adarves, Alhambra, Granada.The Alhambra complex dates from the ninth century. A strategic location in the hills above Granada, by the thirteenth century it had been expanded and made a royal residence for the kings of the Nasirid dynasty. The Jardín de los Adarves (Garden of the Ramparts) are so-called because of their location along the parapet walkways by the ramparts under the fortress. These ramparts lead to the Alcazaba, a fortress and one of the oldest sections of the Alhambra. The gardens have some of the best views the Alhambra offers, facing west over the river Darro and Granada.A tantalizing view to the expanse of sunlit Granada is visible through a doorway just beyond the central fountain. Sorolla employs shadow and light, as well as the verdant protection of trees and vines, to guide the viewer. The path takes you to the Alcazaba, through this deserted and seemingly secret garden. The quiet tranquility provides a moment of respite for the viewer and the artist, who painted gardens as “a refuge from the fatigue produced in him by the social life he was obliged to lead by official commissions, and that is the reason why the human figure is always absent” (Sorolla. Gardens of Light, p. 136).Jardín de los Adarves, Alhambra, Granada was included in Sorolla’s second American tour, which travelled to Chicago and St. Louis in 1911. Despite being occupied with a number of portrait commissions in Chicago after the exhibition ended, Sorolla made a day trip to St. Louis to approve the installation at The City Art Museum. According to a reporter from the Post-Dispatch, the artist waxed poetic about the city’s beauty, 'The air is more beautiful, more clear than in Spain... that so beautiful a city as St. Louis existed in the West, I did not dream...

Eight years later he commissioned the architect John Clarke to design and build a new mansion at Roundhay. It took fifteen years before the Greek Revival house was completed with seventeen bedrooms and lavish entertaining rooms. The natural features of the property were developed to form an impressive country estate with a ravine, lake, waterfalls and woodland walkways. At the end of the three-quarter of a mile long drive Clarke designed a folly in the form of a medieval castle which had a wooden roof so that dinners could take place overlooking the glorious parkland. It was from the ramparts of this folly that Grimshaw painted the thirty-three acre lake which had been built in just two years by soldiers that had returned from the Napoleonic wars and thus named Waterloo Lake.John Atkinson Grimshaw painted several views of Roundhay Park from 1872 onwards until his death. His first three paintings of the park were commissioned by a committee of the House of Lords in connection with the Leeds Corporation Improvement Bill. The Corporation of Leeds were intending to purchase Roundhay Estate following the death of Nicholson in 1871. Nicholson had no heir and the Corporation wished to buy the estate and make it a public park. The purchase was successful and the park was opened to the public on the 19th September 1872 by Prince Arthur. However, the Major of Leeds, John Barron, was severely criticized for investing in what was generally regarded to be a 'white elephant' as the park was far out of Leeds and not easily accessible.It was the remote mystery of Roundhay that attracted Grimshaw who found in the wilderness of the park and the haunting beauty of its ruins the same enigmatic beauty he had painted in the lonely suburban streets and faded glories of manor gardens of Leeds, where ivy and dry leaves veil the golden landscape. The present painting is a sensitive and poetic example of Grimshaw's depictions at Roundhay, capturing the elongated Waterloo Lake. An earlier example painted in 1879 was sold at Christies, 8 November 1996, lot 47. Grimshaw loved the natural beauty of Roundhay but also recognized the ancient serenity of its woods, which in the thirteenth century had been the hunting grounds of the DeLacy family of Pontefract Castle.Roundhay remains a public park and is now well regarded by the Leeds residents and the wildlife that is now protected within its boundaries. Flocks of mute swans still nest on Waterloo Lake as they did in Grimshaw's day and the scene has changed very little since Grimshaw painted it and since DeLacy rode through the trees hunting wild boar.British",70000,90000,,USD,FALSE,"70,000","90,000",$0.00 ,TRUE

Sancerre’s steep vineyards have a grandeur found nowhere else in the Loire. Pouilly and Sancerre conclude a soil crescent that runs from the Aube through Chablis, dominated by limestone which gives the white wines their minerality.Delpy painted this richly-colored view of the Sancerre hills at dawn with a deep impasto, reminiscent of his contemporaries – the Impressionists. Harvesting began in the cool before the sun, unseen and only just illuminating the sky, rose; the previous night’s near-full moon sets in the painting’s west.

Weeks and stamped with the artist's Moghul device (lower right)The following condition report was kindly provided by Simon Parkes Art Conservation, Inc.: This work is in very good condition, but the restoration is misleading. The canvas has been lined with wax onto a transparent piece of Mylar. While this lining allows one to see the reverse of the original canvas, it also shows the two or three breaks in the upper quarter of the picture and a few small holes elsewhere. The tacking edges are intact and have been reinforced with a heavy linen. The canvas is stretched on a mechanical stretcher. The retouches that have been applied are very heavy handed. The most notable restoration is in the white vertical column to the immediate left of the woman in the balcony in the upper right, where a very thin line of damage has been very broadly and poorly restored. The condition is generally very good throughout the figures and animals, but there is an overly broad restoration in the lower left. There are a few retouches in the haunches of the horse nearest the center. There is another poorly applied retouch in the upper center, which addresses a small paint loss. The work would certainly respond well to proper restoration.Catherina Leone, West Hills, CaliforniaAcquired from the above by the present owner, circa 2010Edwin Lord Weeks was primarily interested in depicting everyday scenes from the places he traveled, and the present work demonstrates his keen eye for detail in addition to his enthusiasm for the culture in which he immersed himself. The artist presents a moment of respite and calm under the hot sun. a scene he likely witnessed many times throughout his travels to India and surrounding regions. A group of men stand at the ready with the horses, though it is unclear if they are about to embark for a hunt or if they have just returned. Before the group is an exquisite white marble building, with intricately carved and frescoed walls (such as the elephant between the two windows). A group of ladies, their colorful garb a contrast to the white screened porch on which they stand, seek shade and observe the men below. Though the exact location is unknown, it is likely India, as Weeks’ Moghul 'star-in-circle' signature (below his name) appears in a number of his paintings of India during the 1880s.Weeks was one of the most important American Orientalist painters of the late nineteenth century and, unlike many of his peers, his work reflects his travels to the regions he depicted. Weeks' first trip to India in 1882-83 proved to be an immense source of inspiration and he returned to the country intermittently over the following decade. In 1892, Weeks traveled overland from Turkey to India by way of Persia and published a travel account in serial format for Harper’s Bazaar magazine, titled From the Black Sea through Persia and India, which earned him fame and widespread artistic recognition in Europe and America. Throughout these trips, he was an indefatigable worker, known to set up a camp stool in the midst of a busy market to record local models. Weeks also purchased photographs, in addition to taking and developing his own, which he frequently used to record the architectural details of the cities he encountered during his travels. As Gerald M. Ackerman writes: 'His ability to draw ethnic types without condescension or caricature, his skill in putting together grand compositions, his ability to tell convincing tales – all these skills make his paintings compelling. His wonderful eye for architecture, not just for its stylistic niceties, but also for its presence in sunlight, transmits a view of the past that has to be accepted as true' (Gerald M.

For Koester, it was not just ducks as wildlife that were of interest, but also the spontaneous effects of sunlight on the bird’s white, beige, and grey feathers and on the reflections in the rippling water.Like the Impressionists, Koester was intrigued by the fleeting play of light on rippling water, leaves in the wind and the rhythmical qualities of ducks moving in gracious formation, giving his paintings a distinctly lyrical quality; it is likely no coincidence that Koester was an accomplished violinist and collector of the instrument.In the present work, Koester takes an elevated viewpoint that pushes the horizon out of the frame, directing the viewer’s focus to the group of ducks and the golden sunlight striking the ground. The artist carefully rendered each duck and revisited this composition at least three times with minor edits to the number of ducks in the background and the direction in which their heads point. Koester has carefully studied these ducks in their natural habitat, staying true to his academic training and lending the fowl an endearing character and presence of their own.Property from a Private East Coast CollectionGerman",25000,35000,25200,USD,TRUE,"25,000","35,000","$25,200.00 ",TRUE

The electric coloration remains rich and saturated, with no apparent fading.Galeria Luisa Strina, São PauloIf One Thing Matters Everything Matters: Wolfgang Tillmans (London: Tate Britain, 2003), p. 232In the earliest period of his career, Wolfgang Tillmans experimented with enlarging and distorting his own photographs with a photocopier, delighted by the inherent possibilities of chance involved. He made subsequent cameraless works by folding photographic paper in various ways (both before and after processing), running paper through a dirty processing machine, or applying chemicals to the paper. In the series Mental Images, Tillmans created vibrant images by placing colored string lights on the light-sensitive photographic paper; here, the twisted wire and vividly glowing bulbs are clearly visible in several areas.Although the human brain naturally struggles to find reason and narrative within an abstract image, Tillmans’s intention is simply that color and shape be implemented as a mode of expression, devoid of agenda. Tillmans rejects hierarchy or attempts to rate one form or period of his work over another. In this sense, the title of his 2003 Tate Britain retrospective – If One Thing Matters, Everything Matters – seems particularly apt.For Tillmans, the content of the image – the visual information – as well as the actual physical presence of the object itself are of equal importance. In this sense, the expressions of light on paper (luminograms) or the silhouette of articles placed over paper (photograms) become not just photographs but sculptural objects as well.",40000,60000,44100,USD,TRUE,"$40,000.00 ","$60,000.00 ","$44,100.00 ",FALSE

There are occasional fingerprints in the black margins and insignificant soiling on the reverse.C. Grimaldis Gallery, Baltimore, 1991Leland Rice, Up Against It: Photographs of the Berlin Wall (Albuquerque, 1991), pl. 38Leland Rice, a self-described ‘visual archeologist,’ began photographing the Berlin Wall in 1983, returning each year to document its ever-evolving surface of imagery and text until its fall in November 1989. The artist commented:‘Accumulated over many years, countless graffiti had turned the Wall into a semantic playground full of forceful messages. I gradually realized that I no longer could relate to the Wall as just a physically tangible medieval barrier symbolizing the ideological division of Europe. Certainly the Wall did exist for divisive reasons, but now it took on another purpose for me - that of a creative catalyst. And, since walls had long been a primary subject of my work as an artist, I felt deeply compelled to photograph it.’ (Leland Rice, as quoted in Up Against It: Photographs of the Berlin Wall, p. 114)Indeed, photographing walls in various forms had been a particular focus for Rice. In the mid-1970s, he repeatedly photographed vacant interiors, which he titled Wall Sites. By the late 1970s he documented the walls in painters’ studios where the traces and run-offs from canvases accumulated.Rice’s Berlin Wall photographs capture the transitory mash-ups of texts, poetry, pictograms, and expletives that we now read as a visual archive of the Cold War era. In the sliver of wall shown in the present work, Rice recorded a roster of names (Alex, Olaf, Femke, Jasper, and Indra, among others); a profile of a face drawn with yellow spray paint and finished with menacing red teeth; a Cheshire-like cat sketched in white chalk; and a stenciled figure of a runner carrying a torch. Other images and text are completely obscured by the layers drawn on top of them, a palimpsest that cannot be unraveled.Rice’s work is in the collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; the Art Institute Chicago; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.Property from the Collection of Dr. Joseph D.

The experience laid the groundwork for this series of work. The artists met in the mid-1990s when British Vogue commissioned Luchford to take a portrait of Saville. During this meeting, Luchford shot Saville as she pressed her face against a piece of Plexiglass, which compressed and magnified the features of her body.While both British artists came to prominence in their respective fields in the 1990s, their work at the time could not have been more disparate. Luchford was well-known for his sleek editorial photographs of glamorous supermodels that appeared in top fashion magazines and narrative, film-like campaigns for Prada and other high-fashion brands. On the other hand, ‘Young British Artist ’ (YBA) Saville became infamous for her monumental, richly colored, highly textured figurative paintings portraying nude women at unusual, distorted angles. Despite the polarity of their practices, in Closed Contact the pair found an artistic kinship that married elements of both their practices.Luchford applied the highly cinematic qualities characteristic of his work, including dramatic lighting and deliberate cropping. Trading her bravura brushwork for photography, Saville continued her examination of the visceral qualities of the human form with the same scale, energy, and physicality inherent to her paintings.As the subject of this work, Saville refuses an objective position by evoking the abject. By employing the ‘aesthetics of disgust,’ Luchford and Saville present the raw, unflinching truth of flesh, prompting viewers to interrogate deeply entrenched assumptions of beauty and the permeation of female objectification in Western culture (Michelle Meagher, ‘Jenny Saville and a Feminist Aesthetics of Disgust,’ A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, vol. 18, no. 4, p. 23).The Closed Contact series was exhibited in its entirety at Gagosian Beverly Hills in 2002. Photographs from the series are held in institutional collections including the Aberdeen Art Gallery and the Denver Art Museum (2001.852).",10000,15000,11340,USD,TRUE,"$10,000.00 ","$15,000.00 ","$11,340.00 ",FALSE

Pegg and Zhang Lidong, The MacLean Collection: Chinese Ritual Bronzes, Chicago, 2010, pl. 15.In Chinese Bronze Age culture, ding were the most ritually significant among bronze ceremonial vessels, and the most closely associated with kingship and high rank. The vast majority of Shang and Zhou dynasty ding were produced with round bodies, and by contrast those with rectangular bodies (fangding) were comparatively rare. According to legend, the first bronze fangding was cast by Yu the Great, founder of the Xia dynasty. Archaeological evidence has yet to reveal pre-Shang bronze fangding; however, pottery versions from the Erlitou and Erligang periods do survive. In the Shang and Zhou dynasties, bronze fangding were used in ancestral worship and other sacrificial ceremonies, and their ownership appears to have been strictly regulated. Li Xixing notes in The Shaanxi Bronzes, Xi’an, 1994, p. 35 that in the Western Zhou dynasty, the gentry was allowed to acquire three ding, high officers five, dukes seven, and the king nine. This suggests that the present fangding would have originally belonged to one of the most elite members of the Western Zhou nobility.This fangding is attributed to the early Western Zhou dynasty based on its stylistic characteristics, most notably the flat base and proportions of the body to the legs, and the avian-like features of the creatures in the top register of the sides. Other fangding cast in the same design, varying only slightly in the contours of the taotie, include one in the collection of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm, published in Bernard Karlgren, 'Some Bronzes in the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities', Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, no. 21, 1949, pl. 1; one in the Shanghai Museum, Shanghai, illustrated in Chen Peifen, Xia Shang Zhou qingtongqi yanjiu: Xi Zhou, Shang [Study of Bronzes from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasties: Western Zhou, vol. 1], Shanghai, 2004, no. 203; and one in the Idemitsu Museum, Tokyo, published in Sugimura Yuzo, Idemitsu bijutsukan sensho, 3: Chugoku kodoki [Selected works from the Idemitsu Museum, 3: Ancient Chinese bronzes], Tokyo, 1966, pp 80-83, pl. 3.

Pegg and Zhang Lidong, The MacLean Collection: Chinese Ritual Bronzes, Chicago, 2010, pl. 18.The present gui is notable for its elaborate decoration, which combines both the 'diamond and boss' pattern and serpent motifs. While both designs were popular during the late Shang to early Western Zhou dynasty, a combination of the two is especially rare. Very few examples, which have been attributed to the early Western Zhou period, appear to be recorded. See a bronze gui raised on a square pedestal from the Palace Museum, Beijing, similarly decorated around the body with bosses on a diamond ground and bands of serpents encircling the foot and neck. The rubbing of the vessel is illustrated in Wu Zhenfeng, Shang Zhou qingtongqi mingwen ji tuxiang jicheng [Compendium of inscriptions and images of bronzes from Shang and Zhou dynasties], vol. 1, Shanghai, 2012, no. 04036. Another related example is the famous Hong gui in the Shanghai Museum, Shanghai. This remarkable vessel is supported on four legs and set with a pair of elephant handles. The body is similarly decorated with the 'diamond and boss' pattern and a narrow band of serpents around the neck; see Chen Peifen, Xia Shang Zhou qingtongqi yanjiu: Xi Zhou pian, shang [Study of archaic bronzes from Shang, Shang and Zhou dynasties: Western Zhou dynasty, vol. 1], Shanghai, 2004, pl. 231.The first pictogram from the inscription on the present bronze identifies the owner of the vessel as Lü. An alternative interpretation of this pictogram considers it as a compound character reading Xing Lü. The history of the Lü clan can be traced to the Shang dynasty, as the same pictogram can be found on a few late Shang bronzes. See a gui from the Arthur M. Sackler Collection, now in the National Museum of Asian Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (acc. no. S1987.51), published in Robert W. Bagley, Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M.

Selected Treasures of Chinese Art, Hong Kong Museum of Art, Hong Kong, 1990, cat. no. 183.Art Treasures from Shanghai and Hong Kong, The University of Hong Kong Art Gallery, Hong Kong, 1996, cat. nos 7 and 8.The present pair of jian belong to a group of vessels produced around the end of the Spring and Autumn period at Liyu, Shanxi province. The group first became known through a 1923 excavation from which twenty-eight vessels were published in Umehara Sueji, Sengoku-shiki doki no kenkyu [Research on Warring States bronzes], Kyoto, 1936. The characteristics of the 'Liyu' style were later closely analyzed by George W. Weber in The Ornaments of Late Chou Bronzes: A Method of Analysis, New Brunswick, 1973, pp 369-538, 557-562. In his typology of Liyu bronzes, Weber identified the interlocking dragon band found on the present jian as a defining characteristic of Group E vessels with zoomorphic motifs, and noted that Group E vessels are among the most typical of Liyu production around the first quarter of the 5th century BC (ibid., pp 369-375). The band can be recognized by its repeating units of two intertwined serpentine dragons, one with the bifurcated tail forming the upper border of the band and its sinuous body descending and forming a hook within the unit, its mate taking the opposite form from the lower border of the band, and the bodies of the two interlacing within the unit. The bodies of the dragons are patterned with modified leiwen spirals.Other bronze vessels belonging to this group and bearing interlocking dragon bands of the same design include a jian from the Lucy Maud Buckingham Collection and now in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago (coll. no. 1930.704), published in Charles Fabens Kelley and Ch'en Meng-Chia, Chinese Bronzes from the Buckingham Collection, Chicago, 1946, pl. LI. A number of ding and covers bearing this distinctive band design also survive, include one formerly in the collections of David David-Weill and Arthur M. Sackler and published in Jenny So, Eastern Zhou Ritual Bronzes from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections, vol. III, New York, 1995, no. 16; one excavated from Tomb 251, Jinshengcun, Taiyuan, Shanxi province (ibid., fig. 16.1); one in the National Museum of Asian Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

This style is named for the region around the ancient Wu State (modern Jiangsu and eastern Anhui provinces) along the eastern reaches of the Huai River, where it was produced. The style developed from 6th century and contemporaneous zoomorphic motifs prevalent in bronze, lacquer, and carved wood designs in the neighboring Chu State, in which the creatures' bodies are comprised of curls, volutes, and comma-like elements. In its mature expression, Chu curvilinear elements became so richly executed that they that they nearly obscured the anatomy of the discrete animals, and dissolved patterns of interwoven creatures into fields of swirling textures. A prime example of this Chu mode of ornamentation is found a bronze bell known as the 'Wangsun Yizhe yongzhong', dated by inscription to 550 BC, and now in the collection of the Asian Art Museum, San Francisco (obj. no. B60S552). By circa 500 BC, artisans in the Wu State had taken the abstraction a level further by subordinating the zoomorphic impulse and reducing the decorative unit to curls or commas alone, so that that the motif became entirely non-figural.This highly abstract curling comma pattern fills the bands and lappets on the present jian and also decorates three nearly identical jian each bearing inscriptions citing Wu kings who ruled at the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The earliest of the group, known as the 'Wu Wang Guang jian', was commissioned by King Helu of Wu (formerly known as Prince Guang of Wu, r. 514-496) as part of the dowry for his daughter Shuji's marriage to Marquis Zhaohou of Cai (also known as Marquis Houshen of Cai, r. 519-491 BC), and is now in the collection of the Anhui Provincial Museum, Hefei. The other two jian both bear the names of King Helu's son and successor, King Fuchai of Wu (r. 495-473 BC): one is in the collection of the Shanghai Museum, Shanghai, and published in Chen Peifen, Xia Shang Zhou qingtongqi yanjiu: Dong Zhou pian, Shang [Study of Bronzes of the Xia, Shang and Zhou Dynasties: Eastern Zhou, vol. 1], Shanghai, 2004, no. 507; the other was formerly in the collection of Herr Hans Georg Oeder, and later in the Staatliche Museum, Ostasiatische Abteilung, Berlin, and now believed to be in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, published in George W. Weber, The Ornaments of Late Chou Bronzes: A Method of Analysis, New Brunswick, 1973, p. 45, pl. 5. Of these three comparable jian, the present example is most similar to the one commissioned by King Helu, in that they both have the comma-patterned relief at the rim, have volutes at the lower ends of the handles, and have similarly shaped beast masks at the handles with openwork antlers. This strongly suggests that the present jian was also produced at or around the time of King Helu's reign.For massive Spring and Autumn period bronze jian sold at auction, but with differences in the handles and the decorative bands, see a pair sold at this auction house London, 13th November 2001, lot 48; a pair sold in our London rooms, 14th November 2000, lot 10; and a single jian sold in these rooms, 21st September 2005, lot 158.",80000,120000,441000,USD,TRUE,"$80,000.00 ","$120,000.00 ","$441,000.00 ",UNKNOWN

According to legend, King Yu, founder of the Xia dynasty, cast nine large bronze ding, one for each of the nine provinces in his kingdom. This form, which continuously evolved over the centuries, derived from pottery tripod vessels made in the preceding Neolithic period. Used during ritual ceremonies as food or cooking vessels, ding continued to play an important role in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, as evidenced by the large numbers found in royal tombs. The tomb of Fu Hao in Anyang, for example, contained over twenty-six vessels of this type.The design of such large taotie masks covering the globular lobed body of the vessel, and featuring protruding eyes, raised curled horns and curved fangs, is a motif most frequently found in the Shang/Western Zhou transitional period. Excavations in 1984 of tomb M1713 in Anyang, Henan, revealed a liding of similar design, the Ya Yu Ding, recorded in the Institute of Archaeology CASS, Yinxu xin chutu qingtongqi [Ritual bronzes recently excavated in Yinxu], Beijing, 2008, pl. 196.

During his appointment to China, Francesco Taliani actively collected and purchased works of art from dealers in Shanghai and Beijing.He was sent to China in 1938 as Ambassador to the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, and witnessed first-hand the Second Sino-Japanese War. In this capacity, he was recognized by the Japanese puppet government under Wang Jingwei.

This aesthetic was applied to images of both real and mythical creatures, and across artistic mediums. At the same time, lapidary arts flourished, and jade animals of unprecedentedly high quality started to be carved. The present bixie is a superb example of the sculptural practices of the period, and the era's enthusiasm for miraculous creatures that were believed to be portents possessing supernatural power.A number of similar jade bixie attributed to the Han dynasty are known. Compare one exhibited in Chinese Jades from Han to Ch’ing, Asia House Gallery, Asia Society, New York, 1980, cat. no. 11. A similar jade bixie, also poised in a crouching prowl and with the face turned to the side, sold in these rooms, 2nd November 1979, lot 51, and was subsequently illustrated in Jessica Rawson, Chinese Jade–From the Neolithic to the Qing, London, 1995, pl. 26:7.

S1987.797), was included in the exhibition 5000 Years of Chinese Jade: Featuring Selections from the National Museum of History, Taiwan and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, San Antonio Museum of Art, San Antonio, 2011, cat. no. 47. A jade beast of this type with an elongated body from the Qing Court Collection, is published in The Complete Collection of Treasures of the Palace Museum: Jadeware I, Hong Kong, 1995, pl. 201.The present jade bixie is also strikingly similar to the creature on the finial of a Han dynasty seal illustrated in Gu Fang, ed., Zhongguo chu tu yu qi quan ji: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei [The Complete Collection of Unearthed Jades in China: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei], Beijing, 2005, vol. 1, p. 195. It also bears a strong resemblance to a gilt-bronze 'mythical beast' mat weight attributed to the Han-Six Dynasties sold in these rooms, 17th March 2021, lot 198.Close comparisons can also be drawn between the present carving and three jade bixie that have been attributed to the Six Dynasties.

The Mission, which operated from 1872 to 1881, sent 120 Chinese youths to live with American families and study in New England secondary schools, and subsequently study in American universities, with the aim that graduates would return to China and contribute to China's modernization and ‘Self-Strengthening’ efforts. As part of that pioneering program, Liang entered Hartford Public High School in Connecticut in 1874 and went on to graduate from Yale University (class of 1882). Following his return to China, Liang served in numerous important roles as a politician, diplomat, and advocate for education starting in the late Qing dynasty. Among his distinguished positions were his tenure as President of Beiyang University in Tianjin (1904-07), China’s Minister to the U.S.(stationed in Washington, D.C.) (1907), and the President of the Board of Foreign Affairs (1908-11). His prime accomplishment was negotiating with the U.S. Minister to China, William Rockhill, in 1908-09, to finalize the U.S.-Sino scheme to utilize the excess Boxer Indemnity funds in the creation of a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship. Since 1909, the Scholarship has sponsored thousands of Chinese students to study in U.S. preparatory schools and universities. During the Republic period, Liang served as the Minister of Communications (1914-16) and as the Minister of Foreign Affairs (1917).",30000,50000,107100,USD,TRUE,"$30,000.00 ","$50,000.00 ","$107,100.00 ",UNKNOWN

Bourne Company，科德角，1981年1月10日Trocadero, Kenny & Higgins Asian Art, Inc.，華盛頓，1982年1月Arts of Asia, vol. 12, no. 1, January - February 1982, p. 18.《Arts of Asia》，期12，號1，1982年1至2月，頁18This elegant and serene figure of the Buddha Dipankara reflects the religious beliefs of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1662-1722) and is evidence of the political importance of Tibetan Buddhism during the early Qing period. The Qing emperors’ support of Tibetan Buddhism had both political and personal benefits by securing a diplomatic alliance with China’s Mongol and Tibetan neighbors while assuring rapid progress to enlightenment through personal devotion to its practices. The Kangxi Emperor left extensive material evidence of his personal devotion to Buddhism, including the constructions of Buddhist monasteries and shrines filled with painted textiles, gilt-bronze sculptures, and other ritual implements. Buddhist gilt-bronzes of this period, such as the present example, were produced by the Qing Imperial workshops and are often are often characterized by a strong Indo-Himalayan aesthetic.Gilt-bronze sculptures of the Buddha Dipankara are relatively rare. Believed to have lived for 100,000 years, Buddha Dipankara is one of the predecessors of the historical Buddha Gautama, credited with setting the Dharma Wheel in motion, thus marking the beginning of the Buddhist faith. Dipankara’s prophetic abilities are known from a jataka, stories that record events from the Buddha’s past lives, where the ascetic Sumedha, a former incarnation of Buddha Shakyamuni, offered to spread his hair and flowers on the ground for Dipankara to walk on and avoid the mud.It is significant that the present figure bears stylistic similarities with a famous larger (70 cm high) documentary gilt-bronze figure of Buddha Dipankara preserved in the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence (acc. no. 1989.110.62) included in the exhibition Tantric Buddhist Art, China Institute in America, New York, 1974, cat. no. 22 and illustrated in Denise Patry Leidy and Donna Strahan, Wisdom Embodied: Chinese Buddhist and Daoist Sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2012, fig. 27. The Rhode Island figure bears inscriptions in Chinese and Tibetan language, both of which attest to the date and place of the sculpture’s commission. Thanks to Jeff Watt’s recent translation of the Tibetan inscription, it can be read as: 'made on an auspicious early autumn day in the dwelling place of monks, the Dachong Jia monastery, in the first year of the great Kangxi emperor' (corresponding to 1662). The Dachong Jia monastery had been constructed during the Ming dynasty and was politically and culturally related to the Dro Tsang Dorje Change monastery in Amdo.A similar example of Buddha Dipankara of smaller size is illustrated in Buddhist Bronzes, Phoenix Art Museum, Phoenix, 1969, cat. no. 12.

At both imperial and private workshops, craftsmen working in this medium achieved new heights in terms of virtuosity and scale of execution. The Qianlong Emperor commissioned numerous panels, often in pairs, to adorn the myriad halls built under his direction. Even by his demanding standards, the present pair of panels is exceptional in its exquisite details and painterly qualities. The technical complexity, large format, and sumptuous materials of this pair of panels suggest that they would have been made for an imperial palace.Some carved polychrome lacquer panels of this size and period bear images specifically associated with the Qianlong Emperor, such as an inscribed panel commemorating the triumphant campaigns of General Agui (1717-1797), who spent 1771-76 in the Sichuan mountains quelling peasant rebellions on behalf of the Emperor. A panel from this group is published in Derek Clifford, Chinese Carved Lacquer, London, 1992, pl. 99, and sold at Christie’s New York, 21st March 2000, lot 70, and later again in their London rooms, 12th November 2002, lot 41.

The Qianlong Emperor’s naval campaigns for the pacification of Taiwan (1786-88) were also commemorated in engravings and in corresponding inlaid carved lacquer panels. See, for example, a panel that sold at Christie’s London, 12th July 2005, lot 148.Beyond military subjects, Qianlong-era carved lacquer wall panels also depict landscape scenes, for instance, a pair of carved cinnabar lacquer panels sold at Christie’s New York, 19th September 2006, lot 68, and another illustrated in Edward F. Strange, Chinese Lacquer, New York, 1926, pl. 26; literary scenes, including a pair of panels with images drawn from the Ming dynasty novel Fengshen yanyi [Creation of the Gods] was offered in our Hong Kong rooms, 23rd October 2005, lot 387; scenes of cultural importance such as Wang Xizhi’s (303-361) penning of the Lanting xu [Orchid Pavilion Preface], as seen on a panel sold in our Hong Kong rooms, 23rd October 2005, lot 364, and on a lacquer screen in the collection of the Palace Museum, Beijing, illustrated in Gugong bowuyuan cang wenwu zhenpin quanji: Ming Qing jiaju / The Complete Collection of Treasures of the Palace Museum: Furniture of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, vol.

Painter, Sr. (1867-1940) 及 Maud Wyeth Painter (1885-1971) 伉儷收藏，此後家族傳承This finely enameled snuff bottle is an exquisite miniature work of art created by the Palace Workshops in Beijing, which masterfully unites traditional Chinese motifs with European subjects and techniques, and encapsulates the immense interest in foreign taste during the Qianlong period (1736-95). The European attendant is offering the lady a peach, a Chinese symbol of longevity, while the other lady is holding a porcelain vase modeled after a Chinese archaistic vessel, known as a gu.Starting with the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1662-1722), the emperors of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) developed a fascination with European culture and style. Jesuit missionaries, who had been in China since the late 16th century, exerted a significant influence on the arts and scholarship at the Qing Court. Jesuit artists, such as the famous Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), worked alongside their Chinese counterparts in the Palace Workshops and introduced European ideas and technologies to China, including the technique of painted enamel, as seen on this snuff bottle. Such cultural exchange inspired a completely fresh approach to decorated porcelains, metals and glass, which continued to develop during the subsequent Yongzheng (1723-35) and Qianlong reigns. The present bottle is a superb example of the genre of European subjects in the Qianlong period, as demonstrated by the enameller’s ability to express three-dimensionality and depth on this little container. The fine shading seen on the drapery and the background architecture derive from European painting practices to convey pictorial perspective.Although snuff bottles of this type are rare, a few Qianlong mark and period examples bearing a similar composition are known. See, for example, one depicting an almost identical woman and companion admiring a gu-form vase, rendered in a similar fashion to the present piece and perhaps painted by the same hand, preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (acc. no. 21.175.314), included in the Museum’s exhibition Small Delights: Chinese Snuff Bottles, New York, 2013-14; another, enameled with a European lady and a boy presenting her with a fruit, with the foot encircled by a band of keyfret, sold at Christie’s New York, 20th September 2005, lot 429; a further snuff bottle, from the Meriem Collection, painted not only with a lady and a boy, but also with buildings in the background and formal floral framing borders executed in a comparable style to the present lot, exhibited in the Canadian Craft Museum, Vancouver, 1992, and sold at Christie’s New York, 19th March 2008, lot 275; and a bottle decorated with a young European couple on one side and three goats on the other, both sides connected by a continuous landscape, included in the exhibition Snuff Bottles of the Ch’ing Dynasty, Hong Kong Museum of Art, Hong Kong, 1978, cat. no. 9, and sold at Christie’s New York, 19th September 2007, lot 666.While women and children are often depicted on these containers, it is rather unusual to see a man with a hat as shown on the present piece.

The high quality marble and the ability of the artist to capture the figure's inner serenity are further testament to the period of manufacture, when the Buddhist faith flourished and adherents spent lavishly on devotional works of the highest caliber. The faint smile and partially-open eyes invite a deep spiritual connection between the bodhisattva and the devotee, and encourage the worshiper to pursue the path towards enlightenment and salvation.For examples of other Tang dynasty stone bodhisattva heads of comparable quality and slender proportions, see four published in Osvald Siren, Chinese Sculpture: From the Fifth to the Fourteenth Century, New York, 1925, pl. 465; and another in collection of the Tokyo National Museum, included in the exhibition Chinese Buddhist Stone Sculpture.

The animal is imposing and energetic, with an alert expression, sharp overhanging teeth and finely cast features.Animal-form weights have been used since antiquity, with numerous examples surviving from the Han dynasty, and they continued to be essential for scholars in subsequent periods. The Guyu tu [Illustrated Compendium of Ancient Jades] notes that Zhao Mengfu once bought an ancient jade bixie for use as a paperweight, indicating that scholars would sometimes appropriate favorite antiquities to serve this utilitarian function. The Xuande period witnessed a renewed interest in bronze wares for the scholar's desk, including bronze animal-form weights such as the present lot. For a Xuande mark and period mythical beast-form weight from the Xiaogushan Guan Studio Collection, see Rochers de lettrés, Itinéraires de l'Art en Chine, Musée des Arts Asiatiques Guimet, Paris, 2012, cat. no. 58.

As part of that pioneering program, Liang entered Hartford Public High School in Connecticut in 1874 and went on to graduate from Yale University (class of 1882). Following his return to China, Liang served in numerous important roles as a politician, diplomat, and advocate for education starting in the late Qing dynasty.

H. Hoo, New York, 1960s.S.H. Hoo，紐約，1960年代The famous 'peachbloom' glaze was an innovation of the Kangxi period and technically challenging to produce. Potters would coat the vessel with a layer of clear glaze, followed by a layer of copper-oxide-rich pigment, possibly blown onto the underlying glaze using a straw, and then apply a further layer of clear glaze on top. After being fired in a reducing atmosphere and perhaps finished in an oxidizing atmosphere, the pigment developed a soft mottled red tone with flushes of moss green. From the outset, 'peachbloom' wares have been esteemed by connoisseurs and collectors, due to their aesthetic qualities and the fact that this glaze was applied only to a limited range of vessel types designed for scholarly use.The overall form of this washer is known as tangluo xi, one of the most iconic forms among 'peachbloom' wares. The present washer is, however, distinguished by the additional underglaze-blue strokes at the interior of the foot, which elevate it to a more rarified category of 'peachbloom' washers bearing this feature. Compare a related example with a single stroke inside the foot in the collection of the British Museum, London (acc. no. 1994,0126.1). Another related example with an illegible mark and a few strokes inside the foot is in the collection of the Shanghai Museum, published in Wang Qingzheng, Kangxi Porcelain Wares from the Shanghai Museum Collection, Shanghai, 1998, pl. 208.A washer of this type, inscribed with character wen by the interior of the foot, was included in the exhibition Chinese Porcelain from the 15th to the 18th Century, Eskenazi, London, 2006, cat. no. 8; another from the collection of Edward T.

The Mission, which operated from 1872 to 1881, sent 120 Chinese youths to live with American families and study in New England secondary schools, and subsequently study in American universities, with the aim that graduates would return to China and contribute to China's modernization and ‘Self-Strengthening’ efforts. As part of that pioneering program, Liang entered Hartford Public High School in Connecticut in 1874 and went on to graduate from Yale University (class of 1882). Following his return to China, Liang served in numerous important roles as a politician, diplomat, and advocate for education starting in the late Qing dynasty. Among his distinguished positions were his tenure as President of Beiyang University in Tianjin (1904-07), China’s Minister to the U.S.(stationed in Washington, D.C.) (1907), and the President of the Board of Foreign Affairs (1908-11). His prime accomplishment was negotiating with the U.S. Minister to China, William Rockhill, in 1908-09, to finalize the U.S.-Sino scheme to utilize the excess Boxer Indemnity funds in the creation of a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship. Since 1909, the Scholarship has sponsored thousands of Chinese students to study in U.S. preparatory schools and universities. During the Republic period, Liang served as the Minister of Communications (1914-16) and as the Minister of Foreign Affairs (1917).",80000,120000,441000,USD,TRUE,"$80,000.00 ","$120,000.00 ","$441,000.00 ",UNKNOWN

On the one hand, its form derives from archaic Shang and Zhou dynasty bronze vessels. On the other hand, its unctuous caesious-colored glaze suffused with fine craquelure evokes Song dynasty Guan wares, which in turn also imitated the ancient ritual vessels. Compare the present vase with a Southern Song dynasty precursor (acc. no. 故-瓷-014022-N000000000), which was inscribed on its base with a poem by the Qianlong Emperor extolling the wonders of Guan ware and the guaner form, in the collection of the National Palace Museum, Taipei, exhibited De jia qu: Qianlong huang di de tao ci pin wei / Obtaining refined enjoyment: the Qianlong Emperor's taste in ceramics, National Palace Museum, Taipei, 2012, cat. no. 28.

He owned a gallery on Place Vendôme and later became a curator at the Musée Cognacq-Jay. He was elected as member of parliament for Alpes-Maritimes in 1936.At the time of the German occupation, Edouard Jonas placed his stock of art works on two trains bound for Bordeaux, hoping to send them to the United States. But his possessions were confiscated on 23 July 1940. His French nationality was withdrawn and his works were sequestrated on behalf of Hermann Göring by an order dated 27 September 1940.The two works now presented for sale were listed among works owned by Göring, and were stored with the dealer Goudstikker/Mield in Amsterdam. Göring seems to have owned them until 9 February 1944.On that date, the works were listed in an inventory of 140 paintings that were the object of an exchange with Alois Miedl. Göring exchanged this group for a painting depicting Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, at that time considered to be by Vermeer, but now attributed to Han van Meegeren.The two paintings were then sent to Germany before returning to the Netherlands: this portrait was assigned as a long-term loan to the collections of the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastricht, while the landscape (lot 105) was allocated to the province of Limburg.After the war, Edouard Jonas tried to reclaim his works or receive compensation for them from the German and French governments. He seems to have recovered five paintings and received some monetary compensation.It took a battle that lasted more than sixty years before the two works were finally restored to his heirs.Fruit d’une procédure en restitution durant depuis plus de soixante ans, les deux tableaux (lots 104 et 105) ont enfin été remis à leurs propriétaires.Avant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, ils étaient détenus par le marchand d’art Edouard Léon Jonas (1883-1961). Issu d’une famille juive d’antiquaires, il possède une galerie place Vendôme puis devient conservateur du musée Cognacq-Jay, et est élu député des Alpes-Maritimes en 1936.Durant l’Occupation allemande, Edouard Jonas place son stock d’œuvres dans deux wagons à Bordeaux, dans l’espoir de les envoyer aux Etats Unis. Mais ses possessions sont confisquées le 23 juillet 1940. La nationalité française étant retirée à Edouard Jonas, ses œuvres sont séquestrées pour Hermann Göring par ordonnance du 27 septembre 1940.Les deux œuvres que nous présentons en vente sont mentionnées parmi les œuvres appartenant à Göring, et mises en dépôt auprès du marchand Goudstikker/Mield à Amsterdam. Göring semble les avoir détenues jusqu’au 9 février 1944.A cette date, les œuvres apparaissent dans un inventaire de cent-quarante tableaux, qui ont fait l’objet d’un échange avec Alois Miedl. Göring échange cet ensemble contre un tableau représentant le Christ et la femme adultère, alors considéré comme de Vermeer, et aujourd’hui attribué à Han van Meegeren.Les deux tableaux sont alors envoyés en Allemagne avant d’être retournés en Hollande : ce portrait est donné en prêt à long terme aux collections du Bonnefantenmuseum de Maastricht, tandis que le paysage (lot 105) est déposé dans la province de Limburg.Après la guerre, Edouard Jonas avait tenté de récupérer ses œuvres ou d’en recevoir une compensation auprès des gouvernements allemands et français. Il semble avoir réussi à récupérer cinq tableaux et obtenu une compensation monétaire.Il aura ensuite fallu une bataille de plus de soixante ans, pour que les héritiers obtiennent enfin la restitution de ces deux œuvres.",15000,20000,16380,EUR,TRUE,"$16,078.50 ","$21,438.00 ","$17,557.72 ",UNKNOWN

Several variants of this model exist, one with the inkpot between the monster's fins, as ours, another where the creature carries it on the tail or on its back (Frick Collection, inv. no. 97.2.103), or even a version with two inkpots (this auction house London, 5 July 2016, lot 66).The market for small animal bronzes was flourishing in Northern Italy, notably in Padua, in the late 15th and the early 16th century. Lamps, candlesticks and inkwells, decorated with classical heroes or in the form of satyrs and sea monsters, were very popular.

Following Calvin’s teachings, Prieur turned towards profane subjects such as the figures of Young Man with Gloves and Young Woman with a Basket (Louvre, inv. nos. OA 697 A and OA 697 B), as well as themes taken from rural life, such as representations of animals or, as here, a Peasant Woman Milking a Cow. This became a speciality which earned him the title ‘Master of genre figures’. In the French artistic landscape, largely dominated by the School of Fontainebleau, the rustic nature of this bronze stands out: the peasant woman leans forward to milk a cow, her legs folded underneath her and her dress hiked up to reveal her feet, with a bucket held between her thighs.Prieur’s Peasant Woman Milking a Cow is notable for its rarity: only three complete examples are known – one in the Louvre (inv. no. OA 6073) and two that came onto the market in 1995 (this auction house’s New York, The Cyril Humphris Collection, 10 January 1995, lot 57) and in 2016 (Christie’s Paris, 15 June 2016, lot 43). The present Peasant Woman must be regarded as the surviving part of a fourth composition.In the quality of its casting, the present bronze is closely comparable to the example in the Louvre, although there are some variations. The woman’s clothing is different: in the Louvre example, the woman is wearing a corseted dress, while here she wears a simple shift pinned on the shoulders. Additionally, the nature and size of the receptacle for the milk is different: a small basin in the Louvre version, as opposed to the larger pail in the present bronze.Contraint à l’exil en 1585 en raison de sa foi protestante, Barthélémy Prieur (1536-1611) séjourne pendant neuf ans à Sedan (Ardennes) où il développe sa production de statuettes en bronze. C’est suivant les préceptes enseignés par Calvin que Prieur s’oriente vers des sujets de nature profane comme des figures le Jeune homme au gant et de Jeune femme avec un panier (Louvre, inv. no. OA 697 A et OA 697 B), mais également issus de la vie rurale comme des représentations d’animaux, ou ici d’une Paysanne trayant une vache. Ainsi, il développe une spécialité qui lui vaudra le surnom de ‘Maître des figures de genre’. Dans un paysage artistique français largement dominé par l’Ecole de Fontainebleau, le nature agraire de ce bronze détonne : la paysanne se penche en avant afin de traire une vache, les jambes pliées et la robe relevée laissant apparaître ses pieds, tandis qu’un seau repose entre ses cuisses.La Paysanne trayant une vache de Prieur se distingue par son extrême rareté, puisque seuls trois exemplaires complets sont connus : celui conservé au Louvre (inv. no.

Amphitrite, goddess of the sea, is distinguished by her fresh and graceful qualities: 'Her proportions must be beautiful and elegant. Her flesh must be fresh, delicate, clear and transparent, her face appealing, like the rest of her body. Her drapery should be voluminous, graceful and fluid, just as water itself is beautiful, graceful and flowing.'Between 1654 and 1658, Anguier made a series of life-size Deities in stone for Nicolas Fouquet's Château de Saint-Mandé. Of the fourteen statues, four have survived, including an Amphitrite now in the Toledo Museum of Art, USA (inv. no. 1973.47).Bronze reductions were made throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.In 1693, a bronze Amphitrite was given to Louis XIV by Le Nôtre (Louvre, inv. no. OA11897). Another bronze was acquired in 1699 in Paris by Raymond Le Plat for the collection of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, forming a pair with Bacchus (h. 37cm; Grünes Gewölbe, Dresden). Other versions are known in museums in Baltimore, Hamburg, New York, and in the Petit Palais in Paris.L'Amphitrite tranquille appartient à la série des Dieux et Déesses, réalisée par Michel Anguier en 1652. Formant pendant à Neptune agité, Anguier créa trois paires de divinités mythologiques qui furent identifiées avec des tempéraments et associées à l'un des Quatre Eléments:Amphitrite et Neptune (Eau), Ceres et Pluton (Terre), et Junon et Jupiter (Air).Dans sa conférence à l'Académie Royale en 1676, Anguier définit de façon détaillée les caractéristiques de chaque divinité. Ainsi, l'Amphitrite, déesse de la mer, se distingue par sa fraîcheur et sa délicatesse : ' Elle doit être d'une belle et élégante proportion. Sa chaire doit être fraîche, délicate, claire et transparente, son visage agréable et tout le reste du corps de même. Ses draperies seront amples, délicates et ondées, d'autant que l'eau d'elle-même est belle, délicate et mouvante.'Entre 1654 et 1658, Anguier réalisa une série de Divinités en pierre grandeur nature, pour Nicolas Fouquet au Château de Saint-Mandé. Des quatorze statues, quatre ont survécues, dont une Amphitrite est aujourd'hui à l'Institut d'Art de Toledo, USA (inv.no1973.47).Des réductions en bronze furent réalisées du vivant d'Anguier, aux XVIIe. En 1693, une Amphitrite en bronze fut donnée à Louis XIV par Le Notre (Louvre, inv.no. OA11897). Un autre bronze fut acquis en 1699 à Paris par Raymond Le Plat pour rejoindre la collection de l'Electeur de Saxe, Auguste Le Fort, formant paire avec Bacchus (h. 37cm; Dresde Grünes Gewölbe).

(comme Abel Grimmer).Abel Grimmer rarely signed his scenes of interiors, and many of his works have been attributed to his contemporaries. This is true of this church interior, which has been attributed in turn to Pieter Neefs the Elder (c. 1568/78–1659) and to Hendrick van Steenwyck the Younger (1580–1649), until Bernard G. Maillet endorsed the actual attribution to Abel Grimmer. Indeed, the brown and yellow tones that are characteristic of Grimmer as well as his mastery of perspective are evident in this depiction of the side aisle of a nave with Gothic vaults and tiled floor, the scene enlivened with figures.Although the view of the town to one side is a legacy of his training with his father Jacob Grimmer (1526–1590), Abel Grimmer takes a new approach by setting it next to a church interior. The painter has taken pains to present an accurate depiction of the architecture with its decorated vaults. The nave’s side aisle has triptychs visible on both sides and opens onto a chapel in the background whose altar can be seen. The treatment of every detail and every figure is meticulous.The town glimpsed on the left was described in the 1811 sale catalogue as Ghent, but it is more likely to be an imaginary town.Signant rarement ses scènes d’intérieur, de nombreuses œuvres d’Abel Grimmer furent attribuées à ses contemporains. C’est le cas de cet intérieur d’église, successivement attribué à Pieter Neefs l’Ancien (v. 1568/78-1659) et à Hendrick van Steenwyck le Jeune (1580-1649), jusqu'à ce que la juste attribution à Abel Grimmer soit confirmée par Bernard G. Maillet.On y retrouve ainsi dans le bas-côté de la nef aux voûtes gothiques et dans le pavement carrelé animé de figures, les tonalités brunes et jaunes caractéristiques de l’artiste, ainsi que sa maîtrise de la perspective.Si le paysage urbain sur le côté constitue un héritage de son apprentissage auprès de son père Jacob Grimmer (1526-1590), Abel Grimmer s’en démarque en y adjoignant un intérieur d’église.

Please note that the painting was sold by this auction house in London on 15 July 1955 as by Master of San Miniato.With Schubert, Milan.Galerie Schubert, Milan.This exquisite work, painted on a thick panel, is very probably attributable to Domenico di Zanobi, for whom a coherent corpus was sketched out for the first time by Everett Fahy in 1966, under the name of Master of the Johnson Nativity.In the past it has been attributed to the Master of San Miniato as well as to the Master of the Fiesole Epiphany, who has himself often been identified as the Master of the Johnson Nativity.Domenico di Zanobi was active between 1467 and 1481, mainly in Florence and Prato, assisting Fra Filippo Lippi (circa 1406-1469) with important projects in these cities. When Filippo Lippi died, he pursued his career in Florence, taking over Paolo Uccello's workshop in via delle Terme, and collaborating in particular with Filippino Lippi (circa 1457-1504). Once he had settled in Florence, his work developed perceptibly under the influence of the changes introduced to the art of the late Quattrocento by some of his contemporaries, such as Andrea del Castagno (circa 1419-1457) and Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510).The iconography is consistent with the artist's usual approach, showing the Virgin and Child in an affectionate embrace against a gold background. In his hands, the Christ Child holds a goldfinch, about to fly away, a symbol prefiguring the Passion.It has been possible to identify both the coats of arms that appear in the lower part of the picture, on either side. The escutcheon on the right is emblazoned 'Or, a tree eradicated, proper, supported by two confronting goats, azure' and belongs to the Florentine Tassi family. On the left, with an eradicated tree, accosted by two maces, sable ('D'oro, all'albero di pino sradicato al naturale, accostato al tronco da due mazze d'arme'), is that of the Florentine Lenzoni family, before fleurs-de-lys were added at the top, indicating that one of the family, Giuliano Lenzoni, was made a chevalier by Charles VIII, king of France.Cette œuvre exquise, exécutée sur un épais panneau, revient très probablement à Domenico di Zanobi, dont une ébauche de corpus a été pour la première fois assemblée de façon cohérente par Everett Fahy en 1966, sous le nom du Maître de la Nativité Johnson.Ce panneau a par le passé été attribué au Maître de San Miniato ainsi qu’au Maître de l’Epiphanie de Fiesole, lui-même souvent identifié comme le Maître de la Nativité Johnson.Domenico di Zanobi est actif entre 1467 et 1481, principalement à Florence et à Prato, assistant ainsi Fra Filippo Lippi (vers 1406-1469) dans d'importants chantiers de ces villes. A la mort de ce dernier, il poursuit sa carrière à Florence, reprenant l’atelier de Paolo Uccello (1397-1475) via delle Terme, et collaborant notamment avec Filippino Lippi (vers 1457-1504). Une fois installé sur les rives de l'Arno, son art évolue sensiblement sous l’influence des changements apportés dans l’art de la fin du Quattrocento par certains de ses contemporains comme Andrea del Castagno (vers 1419-1457) ou Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510).L’iconographie ne déroge pas aux habitudes de l’artiste, qui conserve un fond d’or sur lequel se détache le groupe affectueusement enlacé de la Vierge et du Christ, qui tient dans ses mains un chardonneret prêt à s’envoler, symbole annonciateur de la Passion.Quant aux armes qui se situent de part et d’autre de la composition dans la partie basse, elles ont pu toutes deux être identifiées. Le blason de droite, portant « d’or à l’arbre arraché au naturel supporté par deux boucs affrontés d’azur », est celui de la famille Tassi, de Florence. Celui de gauche, représentant un arbre arraché accosté de deux masses d’armes de sable (« D'oro, all'albero di pino sradicato al naturale, accostato al tronco da due mazze d'arme ») est celui de la famille Lenzoni de Florence également, avant que ne soit rajoutées en chef les fleurs de lys qui rappellent que l’un des membres de la famille, Giuliano Lenzoni, fut fait chevalier par le roi de France Charles VIII.",20000,30000,73080,EUR,TRUE,"$21,438.00 ","$32,157.00 ","$78,334.45 ",TRUE

Urrea, « Apuntes para el estudio de la escultura en cera en España», Boletín del Seminario de Estudios de Arte y Arqueología, 1979, t. 45, pp. 488-495.From the sixteenth century, working in wax – a technique already practised by the great sculptors in preparatory sketches (bozzetti) for their intended models – began to be used for the production of small format works, distinguished by their virtuosity and pronounced anatomical realism. Several Neapolitan and Sicilian artists specialised in this technique, including Zumbo, Azzolina, Julianis and Abondio. The art emerged in Spain during the reign of Carlos III, inspired by the presence of Neapolitan works in the royal collection. Gradually, this enthusiasm led to the birth of specialised local workshops, which are still largely unknown today.José Calleja (c. 1670–1700), a sculptor active in Madrid, was a pupil of Eugenio Gutiérrez de Torices (1625–1709). Much of his work is now in the museum of the Royal Monastery of the Incarnation in Madrid. Inter alia, he produced a wax portrait of King Philip V of Spain and his wife, Maria Luisa of Savoy (this auction house, 2 December 2014, lot 83).The present relief depicting Saint Francis of Assisi Meditating is typical of the virtuosity that wax permits. The saint is surrounded by a profusion of rocks, his face and hands depicted in meticulous detail, including his stigmata. The whole is presented in an elaborate ebony frame with repoussé silver appliqués and inlays of tortoiseshell and jasper.Technique pratiquée par les grands sculpteurs afin de produire des esquisses de leurs futurs modèles (bozetti), le travail de la cire se développe à partir du XVIe siècle dans la réalisation d’œuvres de petits formats qui se distinguent par leur virtuosité et leur grand réalisme anatomique. Des artistes napolitains et siciliens se spécialisent dans cette technique tels Zumbo, Azzolina, Julianis ou Abondio. L'art de la cire émerge en Espagne sous le règne de Carlos III grâce à la présence d’œuvres napolitaines dans les collections royales. Progressivement, cet engouement conduit à la naissance d’ateliers locaux spécialisés, encore largement méconnus aujourd’hui.José Calleja (c. 1670-1700) sculpteur actif à Madrid, fut l'élève d’Eugenio Gutiérrez de Torices (1625-1709).

Entouré d’un foisonnant décor rocheux, on remarque la minutie avec laquelle l’artiste a sculpté le visage et les cheveux, ainsi que les stigmates présentes sur les mains du saint, le tout dans un riche cadre en ébène décoré d'appliques en argent repoussé et d'incrustations d'écailles de tortue et de jaspe.",10000,15000,13860,EUR,TRUE,"$10,719.00 ","$16,078.50 ","$14,856.53 ",TRUE

Production of such crosses seems to have been mostly based in a single city, Burgos in Castille, where they were made from the mid-fourteenth century to the 1520s.This magnificent cross, chased on both faces with plant-form motifs, the arms terminating in fleur-de-lys, is inlaid with champlevé enamel plaques. The principal face is decorated with figures of the Virgin and St John standing on socles. There is an angel at the top, while at the base Adam emerges from his tomb and makes a sign of redemption, his eyes raised up to Christ. The enamels portray the two thieves who flanked Christ at his crucifixion. The plainer reverse has Christ in majesty at the centre and each arm is finely chased with a depiction of the Evangelist symbols (the 'tetramorph').A processional cross of very similar facture is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (inv. no 36.134). The iconographical similarities, the enamel inlays and the analogous chased decoration seem to indicate clearly that these two crosses came from the same workshop.Spécifiquement conçue afin d’être exposée lors des processions et non pour rester à résidence dans un lieu de culte, cette croix en bronze doré richement ornée d’incrustations en émail est caractéristique de l’art espagnol du XIVe siècle.

La face principale est ornée d’une figure du Christ crucifié au centre, et les branches horizontales terminées par des figures de la Vierge et de saint Jean debout sur des socles. Au sommet se tient un ange, tandis qu’Adam émerge de sa tombe et fait un signe de rédemption en direction du Christ.

She was the subject of copious sculpted representations in the southern regions of Germany, where she is generally accompanied by her descendants.This Sainte Anne Trinitaire (or Anna Selbdritt) is a typical example of this iconography in Swabian sculpture of the sixteenth century. As was customary for elderly women and widows, Anne is wearing a high veil that completely surrounds her face. She is accompanied by Mary, wearing a crown over her loose hair, in an attitude of prayer, while the Christ Child sits on her knee, his foot in her hand. The pyramidal composition and the difference in size between Anne and the two other figures aims to give prominence to the mother of the Virgin, emphasising the love she brings to her family and underscoring the importance of the female lineage in the genealogy of Christ. In this context, the Christ Child holds a fruit in his left hand, symbol of his relationship with the two women. This Anna Selbdritt is comparable to a Swabian St Anne by Michael Zeynsler (Ulm, 1515–59) in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest (inv. no. 76.4) whose composition and treatment of the figures is similar.Figure de dévotion chère à l’iconographie médiévale tardive et largement popularisée à travers l’Europe grâce aux récits des Évangiles apocryphes, Sainte Anne fait l’objet de prolifiques représentations sculptées dans les régions méridionales de l’Allemagne où elle est généralement accompagnée de sa descendance.Notre Sainte Anne trinitaire (ou Anna Selbdritt) est un exemple caractéristique de cette iconographie dans la sculpture souabe du XVIe siècle. Selon l’usage en vigueur pour les femmes âgées ou les veuves, Anne est vêtue d’un haut voile encadrant entièrement son visage. Elle est accompagnée de Marie couronnée et les cheveux dénoués, en attitude de prière, tandis qu’elle tient le pied du Christ enfant assis sur ses genoux. La composition pyramidale, ainsi que la disproportion entre Anne et les deux autres personnages tendent à valoriser la figure de la mère de la Vierge par l’amour qu’elle porte à sa descendance et souligne l’importance de la lignée féminine dans la généalogie du Christ. A cet égard, l’Enfant présente dans sa main gauche un fruit, symbole de son lien avec les deux femmes.

She is usually shown with a sword and wheel, alluding to her martyrdom, and wearing a crown that indicates her royal origins. Considered one of the three virgin saints, together with Margaret and Barbara, her youthful virginity is evoked by her long wavy hair, hanging loose. This iconography developed in the second half of the fifteenth century and the early sixteenth, spreading to northern France and Flanders.The present saint is distinguished by the gentleness of her narrow, elongated face and lowered eyes, suggesting that she was made in northern France or Flanders at the very beginning of the sixteenth century. Under her feet, St Catherine tramples the emperor Maxentius, who condemned her to death for her faith. She must originally have held a sword in her left hand.Martyre chrétienne ayant vécue à Alexandrie au IVe siècle, c’est à partir du XVe siècle que le culte de sainte Catherine émerge en Europe, en même temps que se développe sa représentation artistique.

Orazio painted several altarpieces, but also ephemeral works, particularly decorations and banners, typifying the art of his time, dominated by the rhythm of religious festivals and influenced by the International Gothic style, then at its peak.Born into a family of artists, Orazio di Jacopo was the son of Jacopo di Paolo, active in Bologna between 1371 and 1426. He was probably inspired by Giovanni da Modena (active between 1409 and 1455) and Michele di Matteo (active between 1410 and 1469), adopting a similar style in his known works and displaying the same skill in the application of gold leaf.Orazio di Jacopo painted the Crucifixion several times. One of the finest examples is the panel in the Museo dell'Osservanza in Bologna, which shows Christ, the Virgin and St John. The present work has more figures, setting it apart from other versions: against a gold background, Christ is surrounded by St Dominic, the Virgin, Mary Magdalene, St John and St Francis.Témoignant de l’inventivité et de l’expressivité des peintres bolonais du Quattrocento, ce panneau est également l’une des rares œuvres d’Orazio di Jacopo qui nous soient parvenues. Auteur de plusieurs retables, mais aussi d’œuvres éphémères, notamment des décors et des bannières, il illustre l’art de son temps, rythmé par les fêtes religieuses et marqué par l’influence du style gothique international, alors à son apogée.Issu d’une famille d’artistes, Orazio di Jacopo est le fils de Jacopo di Paolo, actif à Bologne entre 1371 et 1426. Giovanni da Modena (actif entre 1409 et 1455) et Michele di Matteo (actif entre 1410 et 1469) inspirèrent probablement Orazio, qui adopte dans les œuvres que nous connaissons un style similaire et le même savoir-faire dans le travail de la feuille d’or.L’épisode de la Crucifixion a été plusieurs fois représenté par Orazio di Jacopo ; l’un des plus beaux exemples est le panneau conservé au Museo dell'Osservanza à Bologne, représentant le Christ, la Vierge et saint Jean.

The tilt of the Virgin's face to the right probably comes from the same source. Meanwhile, her posture, especially her left arm with the hand holding a book, is quite clearly inspired by the Madonna of the Goldfinch by Raphael, painted in about 1506 (Florence, Gallerie degli Uffizi) – this helps to date the present work.A more precise attribution of the painting raises several questions. The existence of another version in the Musée de la Cour d'Or, Metz (fig. 1, inv. 2012.5.1), which has sometimes been assigned to the South Italian painter Andrea Sabatini (circa 1480–1530), could have prompted doubts about a Florentine origin for the present work. But the clearly inferior quality of the Metz painting suggests that it can only be a copy of the present work, or perhaps a later version by the same hand, as the many variations may indicate. We must certainly seek this painting's origin in Florence, probably in the circle of Botticelli, or even more probably in that of Francesco Botticini (1446-1498), whose graceful and decorative art was very popular towards the end of the Florentine Quattrocento.The quality of this work, which is in very good condition, enables a robust hypothesis to be proposed, attributing the work to Francesco's son, Raffaello Botticini (circa 1474–after 1520), who took over his father's workshop after the latter's death. There are sufficient points of contact between this Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist and many of Raffaello's works to make this attribution worth serious consideration.The Virgin's facial type, with its delicate and gentle features, the tubular treatment of the drapery and the dense pictorial matter are all elements that can be found in several works by Raffaello between 1509 and 1513, especially in the Annunciation in the Museo Civico de Fucecchio, and the Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist in the Museo di Capodimonte (inv. 759).This welcome rediscovery of an unpublished painting, which has been in a French family for many decades, will surely help to amplify our understanding of the art of the Botticini family and their workshop, just as the Quattrocento was giving way to the Cinquecento.We are grateful to Christopher Daly for his help in writing this catalogue note.Dans une loggia ouverte par deux fenêtres en plein-cintre sur un paysage pastoral, se tient la Vierge assise, avec sur ses genoux le Christ enfant qui se penche affectueusement vers le petit saint Jean-Baptiste et cherche à l’enlacer.Le modèle de composition de la Vierge à l’Enfant se détachant sur un mur ouvert par des fenêtres sur l’extérieur est sans doute à chercher dans la Madone à l’œillet de Léonard (Munich, Alte Pinakothek, inv. 7779) peinte vers la fin des années 1470. Son visage penché, tourné vers la droite, en provient également probablement. Quant à sa posture, et en particulier son bras gauche avec sa main tenant un livre, elle est très certainement inspirée de la Vierge au Chardonneret de Raphaël, peinte vers 1506 (Florence, Musée des Offices, inv. 11890), ce qui permet de préciser la datation de notre œuvre.L’attribution plus précise du tableau soulève quant à elle plusieurs questions. L’existence d’une autre version au Musée de la Cour d’Or de Metz (fig. 1, inv. 2012.5.1), que l’on a parfois cru être du peintre du Sud de l’Italie Andrea Sabatini (vers 1480-1530), aurait pu faire douter de l’origine florentine de la présente œuvre. Mais la qualité du tableau de Metz, inférieure sans nul doute à celle de notre composition, laisse penser qu’il ne peut s’agir que d’une copie de cette dernière, ou peut-être une seconde version plus tardive de la même main, comme pourraient le suggérer les nombreuses variantes. C’est au contraire bel et bien vers Florence qu’il faut regarder, probablement dans l’orbite de Botticelli (v. 1445-1510), ou plus encore, de Francesco Botticini (1446-1498), dont l’art délicat et décoratif fut en grande vogue dans la dernière partie du Quattrocento florentin.La qualité de cette œuvre, en très bel état de conservation, permet de proposer une hypothèse solide, celle que le tableau serait de la main du propre fils de Francesco, Raffaello Botticini (vers 1474-après 1520), qui reprendra l’atelier paternel après la mort de ce dernier. Les points de connexion entre cette Vierge à l’Enfant avec saint Jean-Baptiste avec plusieurs œuvres de Raffaello sont suffisamment nombreux pour avancer cette attribution avec sérieux.Le type de visage de la Vierge, ses traits délicats et doux, le traitement tubulaire des drapés et la densité de la matière picturale sont des éléments que l’on retrouve dans plusieurs œuvres de ce dernier des années 1509 à 1513, notamment dans l’Annonciation du Museo Civico de Fucecchio, ou la Vierge à l’Enfant avec saint Jean-Baptiste du musée de Capodimonte (inv. 759).Cette belle redécouverte, inédite, d’un tableau resté pendant de longues décennies dans une famille française, permettra sans doute de compléter notre connaissance sur l’art des Botticini et de leur atelier au tournant du Quattrocento et du Cinquecento.Nous remercions Monsieur Christopher Daly pour son aide dans la rédaction de cette notice.Fig. 1 Anciennement attribué à Andrea Sabatini, La Vierge à l’Enfant © Laurianne Kieffer - Musée de La Cour d’Or - Metz Métropole.",40000,60000,98280,EUR,TRUE,"$42,876.00 ","$64,314.00 ","$105,346.33 ",UNKNOWN

Although this clothing accessory always calls to mind the famous witty remark made by the diarist Pierre de L'Estoile about fashions at the court of the last Valois king – 'their heads above their ruffs look like St John's head on a platter' – it only rarely appeared in portraits of Henri III. From 1578, after the founding of the Order of the Holy Spirit, the king usually had himself portrayed in a very restrained black costume devoid of any ornamentation, with a small white turned-down collar. Until around 1585, however, a ruff was worn with the ceremonial habit of the Order and that is probably why it appears in a few official portraits from that period. These are all based on the image devised for the king in 1578 by his official painter, Étienne Dumonstier. The present painting is a short bust version of the monumental full-length portrait of the king in Vienna (KHM, inv. GG 8184), very probably by the same hand. The sculptural rendering of the face, while it may not have the finesse of Dumonstier, contrasts sharply with the mechanical rendering of the ruff, which seems to come from a less skilled brush.We are grateful to Mrs Alexandra Zvereva for her help in the redaction of this notice.Dans l’abondante et hétérogène iconographie de Henri III, notre portrait occupe une place à part, puisqu’il montre le roi avec une très large fraise à godrons empesée d’un blanc immaculé. Si cet accessoire vestimentaire fait invariablement penser à la célèbre boutade du chroniqueur Pierre de L’Estoile à propos de la mode de la cour du dernier Valois – « de façon qu’à voir leur teste par-dessus leur fraize, il sembloit que ce fust le chef Saint Jean dans un plat » –, il n’apparaît qu’exceptionnellement dans les portraits de Henri III. Depuis 1578 et l’instauration de l’Ordre du Saint-Esprit, le roi se fait en effet généralement représenter en habit noir très sobre sans aucun ornement et avec un petit col blanc rabattu. Jusqu’en 1585 environ, la fraise accompagne en revanche le grand habit de l’Ordre et c’est probablement la raison pour laquelle elle se retrouve également dans quelques portraits officiels datant de la même époque. Ceux-ci dérivent tous de l’image composée pour le roi dès 1578 par son peintre en titre, Étienne Dumonstier. Notre tableau est une version en petit buste du monumental portrait en pied du roi conservé à Vienne (KHM, inv. GG 8184), très vraisemblablement de la même main. Le rendu plastique du visage, s’il n’a pas la finesse de Dumonstier, tranche avec le rendu plus mécanique de la fraise qui semble d’un pinceau moins fluide.Nous remercions Madame Alexandra Zvereva pour son aide dans la rédaction de cette notice.",20000,30000,22680,EUR,TRUE,"$21,438.00 ","$32,157.00 ","$24,310.69 ",TRUE

In a programme that was as vast as it was ambitious, inspired by Virgil's Aeneid, the young artist displayed his mastery of the fresco technique. He continued his career in Bologna and consolidated his reputation as a fresco painter with his work for the Palazzo Torfanni and with his decoration of Cardinal Giovanni Poggi's apartments.Nicolò dell'Abate was equally well-known in France, where he settled in 1552, playing a key part in the dissemination of the Mannerist aesthetic. With Primatice (1504–1570), he was one of the principal members of the School of Fontainebleau and was particularly involved in the decoration of the Ulysses Gallery and the Gallery of Henri II. He also produced portraits and idealised landscapes with mythological scenes that were very popular in France, as much with patrons as with the next generation of artists, dominated by Claude Lorrain (1600–1682) and Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665).The Portrait of a Philosopher can be dated to the mid-sixteenth century. Produced for a decorative ensemble illustrating a profane subject, it remains difficult to identify the figure with any certainty, although it evokes the iconography of ancient philosophers. The pose, especially the movement described by the philosopher's hands, the profile and of course the supple touch are all characteristics repeatedly found in the artist's work.Peintre originaire de Modène et issu d’une véritable dynastie d’artistes, Nicolò dell’Abate débute sa carrière dans sa région natale et participe à la décoration de somptueuses demeures, notamment celle de la famille Boiardo à Scandiano. Avec un programme aussi vaste qu’ambitieux, inspiré de l'Énéide de Virgile, le jeune artiste dévoile toute sa maîtrise de la technique a fresco. Il poursuit ensuite sa carrière à Bologne et assoit sa réputation de fresquiste en travaillant au palais Torfanni et en décorant les appartements du cardinal Giovanni Poggi.Nicolò dell’Abate est également bien connu en France, où il s’installe en 1552, jouant un rôle essentiel dans la diffusion de l’esthétique maniériste. Il est, avec Le Primatice (1504-1570), l’un des principaux représentants de l’Ecole de Fontainebleau et participe notamment à la décoration de la galerie d’Ulysse et de la galerie Henri II. Il produit également des portraits et des paysages idéalisés avec des scènes mythologiques qui connaîtront un grand succès en France, aussi bien auprès des commanditaires que de la génération suivante d’artistes, dominée par Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) et Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665).Le Portrait d'un philosophe peut être daté vers le milieu du XVIe siècle.

Perrin, ""Charles Hoyau, sculpteur du Mans"", dans le Bulletin de la Société d'histoire de l'art français, 1991.Responding to a growing demand, and to overcome the shortage of stone and wood, the sculptors of the Val de Loire turned to the use of terracotta, a material that was readily available locally, in different colours from white to subtle tones of ochre. Taught by Italian sculptors active in the region, local artists mastered a clearly distinct technique.These sculptures were generally destined for niches, and the modelling to the front is perfectly finished while the back is hollowed out in one or more places. Once the clay had been scooped out from the inside, the piece was cut into sections that would fit in the potters' small kilns. After firing, the elements were reassembled and the joins consolidated. Finally, the visible areas were coated with a white primer and then covered with polychromy that masked traces of the assembly.The emergence of thriving artistic centres in Maine is partly explained by a troubled religious context coupled with destructive events. In addition, the impetus of the Counter-Reformation encouraged a renewal of models and subject matter. The cult of the Virgin was then at its peak and images of her proliferated: the Education of the Virgin, her Marriage, the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Dormition and the Assumption were among the subjects produced in these workshops.The first workshops to become established in Le Mans at the end of the sixteenth century were characterised by a modified Mannerism. The Virgin and Child by Germain Pilon was the model for a type of representation that would be widely used in the Maine region from 1570, the date it was installed in the Abbaye de la Couture (now Le Mans Cathedral). The most important workshops in the first half of the seventeenth century were those of the Delabarre family, Charles Hoyau and Pierre Biardeau. They were organised in family structures and dominated by dynasties of modellers linked by multiple marriages. The most long-established family business was run by Gervais I Delabarre (circa 1560/1570–1640), who was succeeded by his sons, Gervais II (1603–circa 1650) and Louis (1612–1655), and then by his grandson, François (1629–1688).Elaborate folds of drapery wrap around this charming Virgin and Child, which shows the Virgin gently touching the Christ Child's hand. Her facial features and her almond eyes are precisely described, and her hair is carefully combed. These graceful traits, her gentle gaze and the treatment of the drapery accentuating the line of the Virgin's body can be found in other works by Gervais I Delabarre, such as the Seated Virgin Suckling the Christ Child in the Musée du Louvre (inv. n° RF 3663).Afin de répondre à une demande croissante et ainsi pallier aux pénuries de pierre ou de bois, les modeleurs du Val de Loire développent l’utilisation de la terre cuite, matériau disponible en abondance dans la région, dans des tons variés allant du blanc à des ocres nuancés. Initiés par les sculpteurs italiens actifs dans la région, les artistes locaux emploient une technique maîtrisée nettement identifiable.Le modelage des sculptures, généralement destinées à être placées dans des niches, est parfaitement abouti de face, tandis que le dos est creusé d’un ou plusieurs évents. L’intérieur de la terre est évidé, puis sectionnées en abatis afin de rentrer dans des petits fours des potiers. Après cuisson, les éléments sont réassemblés et les fissures de cuisson consolidées. Enfin, les parties visibles sont enduites d’un apprêt blanc puis recouvertes de polychromie dissimulant les traces de l’assemblage.L’émergence et la vitalité des foyers artistiques du Maine s’expliquent en partie par un contexte religieux troublé assorti de destructions. De plus, l’impulsion insufflée par la Contre-Réforme motive un renouvellement des modèles et des sujets. Le culte marial est alors à son comble et ses représentations se multiplient : l’Education de la Vierge, son Mariage, l’Annonciation, la Visitation, la Dormition ou l’Assomption sont autant de sujets produits par ces ateliers.Les premiers ateliers à s’établir au Mans à la fin du XVIe siècle se caractérisent par un maniérisme tempéré. La Vierge à l’Enfant de Germain Pilon établit ainsi un type de représentation qui sera largement repris dans la région du Maine à partir de 1570, date de son installation dans l’abbaye de la Couture (aujourd’hui dans la cathédrale du Mans). Parmi les ateliers dominants la première moitié du XVIIe siècle, citons ceux des Delabarre, de Charles Hoyau et de Pierre Biardeau. Ils sont organisés en structures familiales et dominés par des dynasties de modeleurs liées par de multiples mariages. La famille la plus durablement établie est celle de Gervais I Delabarre (vers 1560/1570-1640) succédé par ses fils, Gervais II (1603-vers 1650) et Louis (1612-1655), puis par son petit-fils, François (1629-1688).De pans élaborés de draperie enveloppent notre charmante Vierge à l’Enfant, tandis qu'elle pose délicatement sa main sur le Christ. Ses traits sont incisés avec précision, ses yeux en amande et ses cheveux soigneusement peignés. Nous retrouvons les mêmes traits délicats, la douceur du regard, ainsi que le traitement des plis soulignant le corps de la Vierge dans les autres œuvres de Gervais I Delabarre, comme la Vierge assise allaitant l’Enfant conservée au musée du Louvre (inv. n° RF 3663).",18000,25000,,EUR,FALSE,"$19,294.20 ","$26,797.50 ",$0.00 ,UNKNOWN

VII, 1904, pp. 45-101.Sculpted portrait busts in polychrome terracotta, widespread in Italy from the fifteenth century, developed in the rest of Europe from the mid-sixteenth century onwards, most notably in the Netherlands, England and France. The fragility of these works, the scarcity of available documentation, together with the fact that a large number of these terracotta have now disappeared, make the question of their origin a complex issue. In 1990, the Louvre organized a symposium on Germain Pilon and his contemporaries that resulted in a synthesis of the extensive research that had been carried out on the French sculpture of the second half of the sixteenth century, and more specifically, on the representation of children (G. Bresc-Bautier, op. cit). First depicted in the iconography of the Virgin with Child, funerary personifications, and allegorical and mythological subjects such as Charity, and Venus and Love, the figure of the child became a theme in its own right in France in the mid-sixteenth century.A few rare examples of busts of children in polychrome terracotta are known. They are all characterized by a sharp sense of anatomical realism, as well as the sculptor’s skills in rendering the facial expressions typical of children. The representation of the youthful nature of these portraits is highlighted by the polychromy that renders–like a painted portrait in three dimensions–the pink hue of the cheeks and lips and the freshness of the flesh that is unique to children. A Buste de fillette (Portrait Bust of a Young Girl) in polychrome terracotta at the Louvre Museum, today considered to have originated in France, late sixteenth century, has been attributed to the Besançon sculptor Claude Arnoux, known as Lullier, and is similar to the work produced by Germain Pilon and his studio (Height: 23 cm/9.06 in., inv. no. R.F. 1646). The attribution to Lullier was based on similarities with two children’s busts he produced, now in the museum of Besançon (inv. no. D.863.3.22 and D.863.3.21). Compare also another Portrait Bust of a Young Girl with clothes and a hairstyle conforming to the customs of the time–even though the modelling is somewhat stiffer–conserved in the Pierpoint Morgan Library and Museum (as originating in Franche-Comté, France or the Netherlands, mid-sixteenth century, inv. no. AZ056). A last bust in polychrome terracotta, the Portrait d’Henri III enfant (Portrait of Henri III as a child), is today attributed to Germain Pilon and his studio (Bode Museum, Berlin). It should be noted that Raphaël Pilon, son and collaborator of the sculptor, continued the practice of children’s portraits in his own studio on Rue Saint Martin. A contract that Raphaël established in 1585 for the portrait busts of a master stonemason and a young girl requires the sculptor to “ensure that the figure is a good resemblance … right down to the belt, and to decorate said figures with paint and flesh in accordance with nature.” (J. Thirion, op. cit, p. 127).Along with the Fillette assise holding a cup (sold this auction house’s, 28 november 2017), our terracotta is the only mentioned full length portrait of a child, and not a bust. Although no other comparable full-length terracotta figures seem to have survived, the existence of such works is mentioned in contemporary documents. The posthumous inventory of Pilon’s studio drawn up in February 1590 with the help of the sculptor Martin Lefort, notes many polychrome portraits–including those of François I, Henri II, the Queen of Navarre and Constable of France Anne de Montmorency–and mentions several figures of children that are both “painted and clothed”. The term figure (figure), used as distinct from that of tête (head) indeed to designate representations of dressed children in full length, the flesh, eyes and hair painted quite naturally (au naturel). The precise descriptions in the inventory throw light on this little-known facet of the work of Pilon and his studio. Thus ""Deux figures d’enfants au naturel, peints et étoffés, 4 écus"" (Two figures of children painted and clothed, 4 ecus) are mentioned in the home of the sculptor (E. Coyecques, op. cit. p. 50). Further on, ""Deux petits enfants assis sur un matelas et qui se mordent le doigt, 3 écus"" (Two small children seated on a mattress, biting their fingers, 3 ecus) are mentioned, followed by ""Cinq têtes d’enfants dont une étoffée, 30 s."" (Five heads of children, including one that is clothed, 30 sols) (ibidem, p. 55).The face of our young boy eating a waffle epitomises the stylistic characteristics distinctive of this type of portrait. The almond-shaped eyes, their outer corners rising, the eyelids in relief, the wide forehead whose pronounced curve is typical of the anatomy of a child, the high hairline with the wavy hair, and lastly, the high, finely-drawn eyebrows are all noteworthy. A similar physiognomy is found in the marble Buste d’enfant (Portrait Bust of Child) at the Louvre. Although the attribution is unconfirmed by any documentation, the artist is universally agreed to be Pilon (in. no. N 15158).Les portraits en terre cuite polychrome, répandues en Italie dès le XVe siècle, se développent en Europe à partir du milieu du XVIe siècle, notamment aux Pays-Bas, en Angleterre et en France. La similitude de ces productions, le peu de documentation disponible et le fait qu’un grand nombre de ces terres cuites aient depuis disparu, complexifient la question de leur origine. En 1990, le colloque sur Germain Pilon et ses contemporains organisé par le musée du Louvre permit de faire la synthèse des vastes travaux qui avaient été menés sur la statuaire française de la seconde moitié du XVIe siècle et, plus précisément, sur la représentation de l’enfance. Influencée par l’iconographie des Vierges à l’Enfant, des génies funéraires ou des sujets allégoriques et mythologiques tels que la Charité ou Vénus et l’Amour, la figure enfantine devient progressivement un thème autonome en France à partir du milieu du XVIe siècle.Quelques rares exemplaires de bustes d’enfants en terre cuite polychrome sont connus. Ils se distinguent tous par un sens aigu du réalisme anatomique et une capacité des sculpteurs à retranscrire les mimiques propres à l’enfance. La représentation du caractère juvénile de ces portraits est soulignée par la polychromie restituant le rosé des joues et des lèvres ou la fraîcheur des carnations propres à l’enfance. Un Buste de fillette en terre cuite polychrome du musée du Louvre, aujourd’hui donné comme France, fin du XVIe siècle, fut souvent attribué au sculpteur de Besançon Claude Arnoux, dit Lullier, et rapproché de l’œuvre de Germain Pilon et de son atelier (inv. n° R.F. 1646). Un buste en terre cuite polychrome, représentant le Portrait d’Henri III enfant, est aujourd’hui attribué à Germain Pilon et son atelier (Bode Museum, Berlin). Notons que Raphaël, fils et collaborateur de Pilon, fit perdurer la pratique des portraits d’enfants dans son propre atelier, rue Saint Martin.L’inventaire après décès de l’atelier de Germain Pilon, dressé en février 1590 avec le concours du sculpteur Martin Lefort, fait état de nombreux portraits polychromes - dont ceux de François Ier, Henri II, ou du connétable Anne de Montmorency - incluant plusieurs figures d’enfants « peints et étoffés ». Le terme « figure », employé de manière distincte de celui de « tête », semble bien désigner des représentations d’enfants vêtus et en pied, aux carnations, cheveux et yeux peints à l'imitation du réel (« au naturel »). Les descriptions précises de l’inventaire éclairent ce pan méconnu de l’œuvre de Pilon et de son atelier. Ainsi est-il fait mention dans la maison du sculpteur de « Deux figures d’enfants au naturel, peints et étoffés, 4 écus » (E. Coyecques, op. cit. p. 50). Un peu plus loin sont consignés à nouveau « Deux petits enfants assis sur un matelas et qui se mordent le doigt, 3 écus » suivis de « cinq têtes d’enfants dont une étoffée, 30 s. » (ibidem, p. 55).Avec la Fillette assise tenant une écuelle, proposée sur le marché il y a quelques années (this auction house’s, 28 novembre 2017), notre terre cuite est la seule à notre connaissance à présenter la particularité de figurer l’enfant en totalité, et non seulement en buste. Le visage de notre Garçon mangeant une gaufre est un condensé des caractéristiques stylistiques propres à cette typologie de portraits. Notons ainsi ses yeux en amandes aux commissures ascendantes et aux paupières en relief, le large front dont le bombé prononcé est typique d’une anatomie juvénile, l’implantation haute de la chevelure formée de sillons ondulants, enfin les sourcils hauts placés et finement dessinés. Nous retrouvons une morphologie comparable dans le Buste d’enfant en marbre du Louvre dont l’attribution à Pilon, bien qu’aucun document ne vienne le confirmer, est reconnue de tous (inv. n° N 15158).",30000,50000,,EUR,FALSE,"$32,157.00 ","$53,595.00 ",$0.00 ,UNKNOWN
